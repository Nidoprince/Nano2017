   <text:p text:style-name="P1"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:tab/>The sky was the color of a sweet breakfast cereal. <text:s/>It was vivid in a way that nothing at home was. <text:s/>Well mostly nothing at least. <text:s/>It was the first thing Ryl noticed as their eyes became functional. <text:s/>So many places had the same dusty clouds, or orange haze. <text:s/>Ryl knew it came from how they found these places, that the way the sky looked had a lot to do with what the sky was made of, and what the sky was made of had a lot to do with whether they could find it. <text:s/>As Ryl considered this, they redoubled their observation. <text:s/>How had they ended up in this technicolor sort of place then? <text:s/>What had made this place stick out, brought an observer all the way to this place? <text:s/>Nothing immediately sprung to mind. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T1">Then, a few more of their sensory organs started working as well. <text:s/>It then became apparent what had stuck out about this space, how this incredible sky had been found. <text:s/>The place was loud. <text:s/>Not in a sonic sense, though Ryl had yet to start thinking about that sense, but rather when it came to less organic types of signals. <text:s/>On every frequency and amplitude possible the place was abuzz. <text:s/>It was almost too much for it to be from a living source. <text:s/>Surely no species could understand anything in this deafening roar of signals. <text:s/>They’d have thought them just noise, and would have filed this away as a place unknown to sentient beings, except that each individual bit of the noise seemed so much like a signal. <text:s/>It didn’t feel random. <text:s/>It was patterned. <text:s/>It was everyone talking at once, in a hundred different languages. <text:s/>Ryl began logging the input on those senses, but pushed it away from their consciousness. <text:s/>It was too much for now. <text:s/>Better to focus on the sky, really see that, then look around in a more conventional manner. <text:s/>So Ryl looked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>The basis of it was blue, but a richer and more vivid blue than any Ryl had seen before. <text:s/>And it was not just blue. <text:s/>As if the sky was painted, there were streaks of other colors. <text:s/>Some might have been clouds, but they seemed too solid, and yet too strangely shaped to be ships or flying things. <text:s/>Bright oranges, pinks, and acid greens stretched across the blue canvas, just massive ribbons of color in the sky. <text:s/>And then even more colors dotted between these stripes, little flecks of metallic looking colors. Perhaps artificial fliers? <text:s text:c="2"/>Before Ryl could observe further however, their attention was pulled downward, to movement nearby on the ground. <text:s/>They had not looked down since they had gained the ability to see, so captured had they been by the sky, so when at last they were forced to look down, it was very hard to understand what was going on. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/>Though never having experienced insects in their home space, somehow a deep primeval part of Ryl’s mind still searched for and recoiled from such creatures. <text:s/>In every such space where they had been present, Ryl had done their very best to avoid interactions or even much observation of such creatures. <text:s/>And so it was, that Ryl’s <text:span text:style-name="T2">immediate</text:span> thought upon turning their gaze down to the ground level, was panic. <text:s/>Their was a lot of very small things moving around, a lot of things that appeared to be webs, and the limbs of Ryl’s <text:span text:style-name="T2">preferred</text:span> body appeared to be being invaded by a large number of crawling creatures. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T2">And so it was to Ryl’s credit that they did not immediately begin flailing about and crushing the tiny things that continued to coat the outside of their body. <text:s/>Instead they watched, just as they had watched the sky. <text:s/>The skittering things were not coating the body in its entirety, just passing over all of it in a wave. <text:s/>Probably some way of scanning. <text:s/>Ryl focused in on the critters, getting a clearer look as other data was set aside. <text:s/>It became readily apparent that these creatures were definitely not organic. <text:s/>They were uniform and looked constructed. <text:s/>And so Ryl straitened out, making sure not to crush any of the little robots, and checked the status of body self construction, wanting to see if their body would change again after the scanning was complete or if the little guys would get an accurate picture of Ryl’s body. <text:s/>Turned out the rest of the body creation was internal, so Ryl hoped they could avoid surprising whoever might be controlling the little bots. <text:s/>While waiting for the bot-bugs to finish, Ryl turned their attention to the things that had appeared so much like webs. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T3">Thin and wispy the things were indeed very web-like. <text:s/>A quick use of the same senses that had made the sky so disorienting soon indicated that the web things were also used for communication. <text:s/></text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T3">Signals flowed through the cords, at a rate and volume that Ryl found incredible. <text:s/>It was always difficult to really understand scale in each new space, but there were more than a thousand layers of these webs between them and the ground, and each layer seemed packed with more connections and conversations than an entire species might want to have in a year. <text:s/>Ryl was again forced to push these senses back in their mind, lest they become overwhelmed. <text:s/>Could they even walk in this world, or were the webs so ubiquitous that no one here moved, simply passing information via this massive network of cables, serviced by the little nano-bugs? <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">Ryl decided to test this out. <text:s/>The bug things appeared to be trying to attach some of the webbing to Ryl’s body and they decided it would be good to see how moving would work before they became incapable of it. <text:s/>Ryl double checked all the limbs were in working conditions, then took a gentle step forward. <text:s/>To their surprise, the webs parted around them. <text:s/>They took another step and the same thing happened. <text:s/>It was incredible. <text:s/>These webs were all weaved together in a thousand thousand ways, and yet they appeared to be able to accommodate arbitrary movement without any of them breaking. <text:s/>Ryl decided to test this hypothesis and began to run. <text:s/>They were fearful of crushing the little creatures or tearing the webbing, and yet somehow neither of those things happened. <text:s/>Everything seemed to flow around Ryl’s body, and their was no friction, just a gentle feeling of moving through a warm breeze. <text:s/>Ryl enjoyed this sensation for a short while, moving through the environment, and feeling the threads move around them, watching as they moved and stretched and never broke. <text:s/>Ryl could not for the life of them figure out how this was working. <text:s/>They focused in on one thread and kept moving. <text:s/>As they stepped forward, it stretched and it stretched. <text:s/>Then it somehow slipped around Ryl’s legs. <text:s/>Ryl stopped, looking back. <text:s/>Had they stepped over one of the sources of the thread? <text:s/>Had they simply stepped over the thread at some point, or had it been pulled down below their feet by another thread? <text:s/>It was impossible to tell the threads apart in the mess of complexity below their feet. <text:s/>Ryl shook their head and decided it was time to start exploring proper. <text:s/>They only had a few more minutes for the day. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">Ryl once again shifted the scope of their attention. <text:s/>Instead of focusing only on the sky, or the webs, or the nano-bots that continued to be constructing something on their body, Ryn extended their senses out more generally, taking in the environment as a whole, trying to get an idea of if there were population centers or some sign of activity aside from the relentless communication in the webs and in the sky. <text:s/>This middle, between the ground and sky, was just as engaging as the other two extremes had been. <text:s/>The horizon was curved strangely. <text:s/>It seemed likely that this space was not a planet or at least not a spherical one. <text:s/>The horizon itself seemed almost knotted, in the same way that the webbing below did. <text:s/>Looking at one place, you could follow with your eyes how it met another spot. <text:s/>And yet no where did either of those two spots cross over some parts of the intervening horizon. <text:s/>Ryl had been to a few places with geometries different than that of home, but never any so blatantly bizarre. <text:s/>It was hard to believe this place could be self consistent. <text:s/>And yet it certainly was. <text:s/>The knotted wire flowed around things, and the horizons touched without moving. <text:s/>But again, Ryl was focusing on the specifics. <text:s/>Only six more minutes to figure something about this place out. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">Ryl did their best to scan the area, not stopping on any one thing too long. <text:s/>They noticed the tall spikes that seemed a cross between a neon tree and a street light. <text:s/>They observed shapes underneath the fog of webbing, domes and pyramids and boxes. <text:s/>It was hard to tell much about them besides the shapes though because of the sheer amount of webbing that covered these places. <text:s/>Indeed, the ground itself was difficult to see, even the bit that Ryl was currently stepping on. <text:s/>The gliding sorta of walk they had initially started using because of their fear of harming the bots or the webs now served them well in that it allowed them to feel the ground as they moved, not having to rely on their eyes to figure out the ground. <text:s/>Thus far they had not encountered any pits, holes, or spikes, but it paid to be careful. <text:s/>It was while they were considering this that they encountered the one thing that they had been banking on to help them out. <text:s/>They saw movement. <text:s/>Though they could not spot the source of the movement, they saw its effects in the ripple of the wires. <text:s/>A goal observed, Ryl glided on an intercept course with the ripples in the web. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">After only a few moments of this course, it seemed that Ryl had been observed by their quarry, as the ripple too began changing course, turning in Ryl’s direction. <text:s/>This brightened Ryl’s mood, as chasing things was rarely good for relationships with said thing. <text:s/>It was always much easier to communicate with the curious then it was the fearful. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">At around the twenty meter distance, Ryl was finally able to see the source of the rippling. <text:s/>Honestly it was less bizarre than Ryl had been expecting based on the level of weird they had already observed here. <text:s/>It looked like a very large, bipedal, version of an animal that Ryl had once seen back in home space. <text:s/>It had a long face, a checkered shell thing, and whiskers. <text:s/>Or at least they seemed like whiskers. <text:s/>It soon became apparent that the whiskers never ended, instead continuing out and around becoming part of the web that surrounded everything. <text:s/>This being was physically connected to the vast network which surrounded them. <text:s/>It has eyes and a big nose as well, but these were apparently not as effective as Ryl’s as the creature didn’t seem to really see Ryl until they were only a few meters away. <text:s/>At which point both stopped, and stared. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">Ryl started by trying words, but if the creature heard their voice, it didn’t respond at all. <text:s/>The creature held up a three fingered hand, and began to sign. <text:s/>Ryl observed and noticed it was repeating a small number of symbols over and over again. <text:s/>Likely simple numbers. <text:s/>Taking a few guesses about biology and upbringing, Ryl took a guess, and compared it against a host of constants that they knew, fundamental constants of the universe that one might use when attempting to find common ground with an alien being. <text:s/>Nothing matched up well. <text:s/>Ryl took another guess, and tried again, and still found nothing. <text:s/>They tried a couple more times before deciding that this might not be what the being was trying to say. <text:s/>Would a random citizen of a space like this know those constants off the top of their head anyways? <text:s/>Ryl was an explorer, and interacted with other species regularly, so they were fundamental to how they communicated, but this wasn’t a scientist or a diplomat, this was just a random member of this species. <text:s/>They were make some repeating symbols with their hands. <text:s/>And yet it seemed very likely that they primarily used their whisker webs to communicate. <text:s/>Wait, that was it. <text:s/>Ryl shifted attention from vision to the spectrum which could feel the messages traveling down the mass of wires. <text:s/>Specifically they focused on the wires the tiny bots had affixed to their body. <text:s/>And their it was. <text:s/>The same pattern being sent down a wire. <text:s/>Or rather two wires. <text:s/>Input and output. <text:s/>And then they had communication. <text:s/>Neither yet understood the other’s language, but by sending and receiving electric impulses along the two wires, communication itself was possible. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T5">A rapid series of communications established some basic methods of communication, getting the numbers across, and then using that and some pointing to start creating some basic syntax with which to communicate. <text:s/>Ryl zeroed in on trying to get across an idea of time, and a way of communicating something like sleep. <text:s/>And with only a few seconds to spare, Ryl did just that, and sent one last message. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T6">Sleep for 40000 seconds.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:span text:style-name="T10"><text:tab/>A bolt of lightning almost struck Tazkia as she advanced. <text:s/>She had managed to juke out of the way, and having done so, she knew the fight was over. <text:s/>She closed the last of the distance, taking little damage from her foes remaining attacks, now that the lightning was out of the way. <text:s/>Once she was in range, she unleashed her own magicks, blasting the bearded, lightning throwing, wizard into oblivion. <text:s/>With the lightning mage out of the way, Tazkia led her forces through the gap, knocking down enemy battlements, and at last, after one more quick skirmish, destroying the giant crystalline structure which served as her foes’ main base. <text:s/>She quickly typed, “gg”, then took her hands off the keyboard as the screen flashed “victory” and the post game stats showed up. <text:s/>When the stats came up, the game changed from full screen to windowed, and Tazkia glanced down at the time, wincing when she saw it. <text:s/>She had class in less than 4 hours, and still hadn’t touched her math assignment. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T11">She could probably get it done in half an hour and manage at least three hours of sleep. <text:s/>As she thought about this, and started recalling what exactly she’d learned about in math last Friday, she clicked through some menu’s and took a look at her rankings after tonight’s games. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T11"><text:tab/>She’d gone up more than a few places in the rankings. <text:s/>She felt pretty good about this, but then she noticed who was right above her. <text:s/>Maybe she could get the math homework done after her morning class? <text:s/>If she only played one more game she’d still get like two hours of sleep. <text:s/>Yeah, she never took the whole two hours for her labs anyways, so she’d finish early, and have time to do the math homework no problem. <text:s/>With one more win she’d officially have the highest rank in her school, and the look on everyone’s faces at the LAN tomorrow night would be worth the sleep deprivation. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T12">She clicked too queue up for another game, but just as she did so, she got an invite to join someone else’s game. <text:s/>She got a ton of invites from folks she didn’t know since she was one of the highest ranking player’s in the country, and she usually ignored them, but this one made her pause. <text:s/>It was the name. <text:s/>Not too many other folks played with Muslim user names, and almost none of those that did were girls. <text:s/>Yet here was someone named Safeerah, inviting her to a game. <text:s/>She checked this person’s rank, figuring it was probably someone pretty low. <text:s/>She wasn’t in the mood to try and coach anyone through the game. <text:s/>But no, this person wasn’t low rank. <text:s/>She wasn’t quite as high as Tazkia, but the next best rank. <text:s/>Intrigued, she clicked accept, dropping out of her solo search and joining up with “Safeerah”. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"><text:tab/>Maybe it was another high ranking player just screwing with her with a name change? <text:s/>Best to check. </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P8"><text:span text:style-name="T13"><text:tab/>Too quick to be google translate. <text:s/>This gal was legit. <text:s/>Tazkia smiled. <text:s/>She was glad she’d decided on one more game. <text:s/>She’d tried to get some of the girl’s on her floor to play a couple times, but it never worked out very well. <text:s/>And she liked playing with the guys, but still, this was kinda cool too. <text:s/>She didn’t ask any more questions, not wanting to seem as intrigued by her gaming partner as she actually was, and soon they were selecting characters for the game, together with a few more randomly selected players. <text:s/>Tazkia managed to work up the courage to ask Safeerah if she wanted to play together in the same part of the map. <text:s/>The mysterious girl agreed and after a quick discussion with the other players, and a short loading screen, they were walking together to their designated sect</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">or. <text:s/>They waited together for shock troops from both sides to lumber their way to the half way point of the map, so that the fighting could begin. <text:s/>Then they played.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"><text:span text:style-name="T15"><text:tab/>Safeera was solid. <text:s/>Nothing exceptional, but very efficient. <text:s/>Always took the high probability plays, never made mistakes, and always seemed to get timings down really well. <text:s/>This worked well together with Tazkia’s more aggressive, riskier, style, and the two quickly gained some big advantages </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">against the opponents in that part of the map. <text:s/>Unfortunately, the rest of her team was not doing as well. <text:s/>While she and Safeera were taking a solid lead, everyone else was down one or two kills. <text:s/>It looked likely that it was going to be one of those games where she did well, did her part, but still lost the game because her companions couldn’t hack it. <text:s/>She tried to untilt her </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T16">teammates, pointing out her own lead, and promising to carry them if they could just hold on out, but one of them was getting angry, and Tazkia was pretty sure the game was about to spiral out of control. <text:s/>She sighed. <text:s/>These things happen. <text:s/>Would have been nice to take the crown for tomorrow, but there is always another day. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"><text:tab/>Still, winning was possible, so she steeled herself for a long drawn out game. <text:s/>If she and Safeera could keep their lead, then they might be able to make something happen in the late game, so long as they kept calm. <text:s/>It was a long shot, but its what she had. <text:s/>Then:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">Safeera: <text:s/>Want to see something cool?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">Tazkia: <text:s/>Um… I guess? <text:s/>You aren’t going to start feeding are you?</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P24"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>Cautiously optimistic, Tazkia followed her new friend towards the center of the game world, where the enemy team had grouped up, taking advantage of her own team’s weakness in that area. <text:s/>As they got close, Tazkia wondered what the plan was. <text:s/>There was no way they could win two versus five. <text:s/>They would be throwing the game to even try. <text:s/>Still, her companion seemed confident. <text:s/>They got to one of their own buildings, just as the enemy advanced with its forces. <text:s/>Time to run. <text:s/>But the girl didn’t run, and Tazkia, despite her plan to play smart, play cautious, stayed with her. <text:s/>Time slowed down. <text:s/>At first Tazkia thought this was just adrenaline, but she soon realized that this was too slow. <text:s/>The enemies were moving like molasses, and she had all the time in the world to dodge each of their strikes, firing her own into the perfect spots. <text:s/>In a battle which, Tazkia knew from experience, should have taken about ten seconds, she and Safeera took five slow minutes, methodically destroying the enemy team. <text:s/>Then, once the last foe had fallen, time seemed to return to normal, and the two of them captured the enemies forward base. <text:s/>The game wasn’t over yet, but that fight had shifted the tempo and the advantage completely. <text:s/>There was a few short seconds of silence over chat, then both her allies and her enemies exploded into disbelieving exclamations. <text:s/></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P27"><text:tab/>She laid down, not bothering to set the alarm after all since she wasn’t going to be able to sleep for seven hours straight anyways. <text:s/>She started to drift off. <text:s/>“At least I can say that I won all those games tonight in my sleep,” she thought, smiling a bit. <text:s/>Then she was out. <text:s/>A little over four hours later her computer woke from its sleep, the game open, with one final message.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P29"><text:tab/>An empty blackness. <text:s/>Yasmit jumped. <text:s/>An empty whiteness. <text:s/>Yasmit jumped again. <text:s/>A patterned blue and redness. <text:s/>He spent a few minutes looking at the pattern, trying to see any meaning in it. <text:s/>He got it after a few minutes and jumped again. <text:s/>Ooh, this one looked like it had physics. <text:s/>Stars were visible in the distance. <text:s/>Yasmit adjusted the settings, jumping from place to place in this space instead of too an entirely new one. <text:s/>He skipped towards stars, cutting the distance in half with each jump until he was close enough to scan for planets or anything interesting. <text:s/>When he found nothing of interest, he moved to the next star, then the next. <text:s/>After a half dozen or so attempts he stopped, did some quick math, then simply jumped directly to the nearest hundred stars for a half second apiece. <text:s/>Saw some color in one. <text:s/>Jumped back a few steps. <text:s/>Zoomed in towards the colorful planet. <text:s/>Scanned it for signs of life. <text:s/>Nothing. <text:s/>Boring. <text:s/>Guess the chemistry is kinda cool. <text:s/>Slightly different elements here. <text:s/>Wait, better check ramifications of that. <text:s/>Damn. <text:s/>Chemistry doesn’t support life here. <text:s/>Next space. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:span text:style-name="T13"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T21">This one was trippy. <text:s/>Glowy balls of skittering colors. <text:s/>Echoing cosmic sounds. <text:s/>Twisting plant things that all seemed to be holding hands. <text:s/>Maybe a bit too random to be likely to contain life, but worth checking out all the same. <text:s/>Yasmit’s scanners screeched. <text:s/>Ah, looks like its a bit too random to support my life too. <text:s/>Too bad. <text:s/>Yasmit jumped again. <text:s/>Another freakin’ empty blackness. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T22">He jumped again. <text:s/>Empty blackness. <text:s/>Again. <text:s/>Whiteness. <text:s/>Blackness… white, white, black, black, white, black… Ooh, colors. <text:s/>Just two back and forth though. <text:s/>Pattern holds across all of space. <text:s/>Once more into the breech my friends. <text:s/>He jumped again.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>Not too much to work with, but Yasmit could make some kind of a change. <text:s/>If some other explorer found this place in a few septillion years, they’d be met with a white, almost emptiness. <text:s/>Working with the forces that his scanners had detected, Yasmit began to create, to make color out of the white space. <text:s/>He’d been planning a whole big sorta portrait thing, but it turned out that making a few centimeters of stuff took like twenty seconds, so that was out. <text:s/>After about a half an hour of creating then moving around, Yasmit was happy with his creation. <text:s/>He looked at some of his other options presented on the scanner, and made sure this space would draw attention should someone happen by. <text:s/>This done, he jumped, leaving the whiteness. <text:s/>The emptiness however was gone, replaced by:</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T26"><text:tab/>A soft but repetitive beeping indicated that the machine was ready. <text:s/>Omth looked at Iefsh. <text:s/>She nodded after a moment, both of them sharing a moment before the pair stepped away from the machine itself and sat down at the two computer terminals on both sides. <text:s/>This was the big moment. <text:s/>They’d both bet everything on Iefth’s theory. <text:s/>And after four years of research and work, they were finally at the point where her theories would be detectabl</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T27">y</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T26"> different than the accepted model. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T27">No one else had thought this area even worth considering, so confident where they in the theories of the genius, Vanstr, hero of modern science, and savior of the world. <text:s/>Now Vanstr was undeniably a genius, but they could still be wrong. <text:s/>They’d come further than anyone else, but that doesn’t mean that there is not further to go. <text:s/>Iefsh had seen another way, another possibility and Omth had had faith in her vision. <text:s/>Now of course, they’d also been madly in love, which tended to affect one’s beliefs a bit, but still. <text:s/>She was every bit as much of a genius as Vanstr and Omth was going to help prove it. <text:s/>This was going to be the proof they needed, the first step in explaining the world from a perspective of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T28">fractal reality, as opposed to the irreducible particles and interactions that Vanstr claimed were the basics of the world they lived in. <text:s/>Just a flipped switch and twenty minutes of observation away. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“You ready for this babe?” asked Iefsh. <text:s/>She reached over the machine, her hand out. <text:s/>Omth took the outstretched hand and squeezed, then just held on. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Not really, but more ready than I likely ever will be. <text:s/>Never been good with the big moments.” <text:s/>Iefsh laughed. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“No, you definitely never have been. <text:s/>I love you still though.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Figured. <text:s/>I imagine if you were too put off by that, we probably wouldn’t have lasted this long.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Maybe I just needed a lab assistant that wouldn’t argue with me too much?” <text:s/>Omth raised an eyebrow. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Somehow I suspect there are more direct methods for that. <text:s/>A half decade of happy marriage is perhaps a bit roundabout for some extra help.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Ya got me. <text:s/>I married you for the help in the lab, and because I think you are hot.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:tab/>“Can’t ask for much more than that.” <text:s/>The two stared at each other some more, an activity the pair tended to enjoy a great deal. <text:s/>Then together, they both looked down at the machine. <text:s/>Wordlessly, Omth ran the scanning program on his terminal. <text:s/>Meanwhile, Iefsh stood up, walked over to the machine, and flipped the overly large power switch. <text:s/>The beeping went silent and the table sized chunk of hardware began purring softly. <text:s/>She sat down, and they both began staring down at the incoming data, rapt. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T28"><text:tab/>A stranger in the room would have barely been able to notice any facial expression change on the pair as they sat still, eyes locked on their screens for twenty minutes, not making a sound. <text:s/>But if either of them had been looking at the other, they would have seen the change. <text:s/>Curiosity and hope turning slowly, every so slowly, into </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T29">resignation and something close to despair. <text:s/>For a long time after the machine stopped humming, neither moved at all. <text:s/>Eventually Omth stood up and walked over to Iefsh. <text:s/>He touched her, and she shot up. <text:s/>They both held each other, and after a stretch of silence, they both began to cry. <text:s/>They hugged and cried and eventually left the lab, walked into their kitchen, and started preparing the food they had set aside for today. <text:s/>It had been going to be a celebration. <text:s/>Instead it was some way of filling the void, of not thinking about all the years of work that had been for not. <text:s/>They ate, and they drank, and they cried, and they made out, and then they went to bed, and fell asleep. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T29"><text:tab/>Omth woke up later than he usually did. <text:s/>He felt cozy and happy, his general base state after he got used to the fact that he was a married man. <text:s/>Then he remembered the previous night and everything seemed to fall away. <text:s/>He could feel by the lack of warmth in the bed that Iefsh was already up. <text:s/>This was unusual, as she usually woke him before she got up, or just waited, watching him sleep till he got </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T29">up. <text:s/>But, she wasn’t there. <text:s/>He shook off the impulse to just sink back into sleep and forget about the whole mess. <text:s/>If he was feeling this bad, then she had to be feeling worse. <text:s/>It had been her idea that was dispelled last night. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T30">He shook his head a couple times, rolled out of bed, snagged some clothes from the ground where he had taken them off the previous night, then lurched out of the room, in search of his wife.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>He found her where he expected to find her, in the lab room. <text:s/>There she was, sitting at the terminal, staring at the numbers again, the machine humming. <text:s/>Considering the scale of what they were dealing with, the chances of a repeat experiment being noticeably different was infinitesimal, but he figured she’d try again anyways. <text:s/>What was another 20 minutes of disappointment compared to the hope of maybe, just maybe, it being a mistake? <text:s/>He started walking towards his own chair on the opposite side of the machine, ready to be there, to go through the data again. <text:s/>If this was what would help Iefsh deal with this, then he’d do his part. <text:s/>When he sat down however, he actually looked at his wife’s face. <text:s/>What he saw there was not at all what he had been expecting. <text:s/>Wonder. <text:s/>Curiosity. <text:s/>Discovery. <text:s/>Had last night been some kind of terrible anti-miracle? <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>Omth considered the data on his terminal, looking for any differences from last night. <text:s/>Nothing. <text:s/>Was Iefsh fooling herself? <text:s/>Was she seeing something that wasn’t there? <text:s/>Or was she seeing something that he couldn’t see or hadn’t considered? <text:s/>Considering his wife, it was the later proposition that seemed a lot more likely. <text:s/>She’d never been one to deny that which she could see with her own eyes. <text:s/>If she was excited by something in the data, then there was something exciting there. <text:s/>He could go over there and see what it was, or he could try and find it for himself as well. <text:s/>Well, his wife was the better scientist, but he was one himself too. <text:s/>Clearing his mind, putting aside everything he had assumed about this experiment, he looked at the data again. <text:s/>Not just the bits that had so interested him that previous night, the bits that would prove or disprove Iefsh’s theory, but instead tried to look at everything. <text:s/>That bit had turned out to support Vanstr’s theories, but maybe some of the other data points, which they had not really been thinking about, where off, where different than expected. <text:s/>Some sort of hope now glowing inside him again, he poured himself into the work.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T30"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T31">Omth was unsure how much time had passed when he finally pushed himself away from the terminal, rolling his chair away from the screen. <text:s/>His mind was abuzz. <text:s/>What could it mean? <text:s/>How did that make sense at all? <text:s/>He glanced up. <text:s/>His wife was pacing back and forth, her eyes up, mumbling to herself. <text:s/>He’d seen it, now was the time for collaboration. <text:s/>He got up. <text:s/>Iefsh zoomed over to him, pulling him into a long kiss, one he had not been ready for, resulting in a deep inhale when at last she let him go. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“You got it?” she asked, all smiles and wonder.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“Yeah, though I don’t understand why at all. <text:s/>I’m so confused.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“Yeah, me too. <text:s/>What a weird algorithm. <text:s/>I mean, its pretty dang random, but still predictable if you get a hold of some data.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“Yeah, who would have thought the universe r- … wait? <text:s/>Random? <text:s/>Are we talking about the same thing?” <text:s/>His wife raised both eyebrows.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“You saw that the data on the particles was following a pattern that wasn’t truly random, that it was some kinda psuedo-random number generator?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“Umm… no.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>“Wait… <text:s/>what did you see then?”</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T31"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">The universe is rounding? <text:s/>When its subatomic particles collide its freakin’ rounding?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“And its also picking random things in a non-random way?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“We should double check each other. <text:s/>I’ll give you the algorithm I figured out, and you show me where the math doesn’t add up.” <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T32"><text:tab/>“Alright.” <text:s/>The pair set to work, working together, checking each other’s assumptions, running numbers and comparing arithmetic. <text:s/>They worked for another couple hours, then, drawn by the siren song of their stomach’s, retired to the kitchen, reheating leftovers from the previous night. <text:s/>Scarfing was the appropriate word to describe their interactions with the food. <text:s/>Iefsh was about to speak, but O</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T34">m</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">th stopped her, motioning towards the restroom. <text:s/>After he returned, they spoke.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“You know what this means?” asked Iefsh. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Um… not exactly. <text:s/>Guess it makes the world feel a lot more ‘manufactured’ to some extent? <text:s/>Like engineers cut corners when they made everything.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Which means this place was made.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Wait, like by a god or something?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Technically possible I guess, but I’m figuring something less religion, and more computer science.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T32"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T33">Oh. <text:s/>Like the whole, “we live in a simulation” idea that was so popular back during the advent of computers?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“Precisely. <text:s/>Or rather, not precisely, which is the whole point.” <text:s/>Iefsh grinned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“OK, so we live in a simulation. <text:s/>Does that fundamentally change anything really? <text:s/>I feel like the fact that it didn’t is why people eventually stopped talking about it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“It doesn’t change anything really if there is no way for the simulation to interact with anything outside it. <text:s/>If we are in perfectly contained simulation, its exactly the same as us not being in a simulation except that some folks we can never experience or understand could presumably turn us off or screw with us in some way. <text:s/>But… that assumes that the simulation is created in a perfectly safe way. <text:s/>Both of the things we discovered today imply imperfection. <text:s/>If we can detect the raggedy edges of our simulation, or raggedy structure, then maybe we can find some other parts that have some flaws?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“Are you implying we either figure out how to hack reality? <text:s/>Like gain super powers and stuff?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“Oh, I guess we could do that too. <text:s/>That could be pretty fun. <text:s/>I was more thinking about escaping it. <text:s/>If we’ve found the edges of our reality, why not explore the reality that built this one?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“Grand ambitions. <text:s/>They’re why I married you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“I thought it was because I look great in skirts and helped you finish your thesis?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“Baby, you look great in anything. <text:s/>Also in nothing. <text:s/>Plus I was going to get my thesis done regardless. <text:s/>You just cut a few months off.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“I cut a year off at least.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T33"><text:tab/>“Fair. <text:s/>But the grand ambitions were also pretty hot.” <text:s/>Iefsh </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T34">gives Omth a kiss and then holds out her hand to him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Want to hack reality with me? <text:s/>For science, and discovery, and also maybe super powers?” <text:s/>Omth takes the hand, and drags Iefsh close, kissing her back and wrapping her in his arms. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Sounds like a plan darling. <text:s/>When do we start?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Maybe in an hour?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“OK.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“You doing anything for the next hour?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Nope, not much going on.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Excellent.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>An hour and a half later, the pair were back in the lab. <text:s/>They’d decided to check for any more flaws in the same vein as the first couple they’d found. <text:s/>They worked quietly, jotting down anything interesting that they found and passing notes via paper airplane. <text:s/>Then Iefsh spoke.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“We going to tell anyone about this?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T34"><text:tab/>“Would anyone believe us? <text:s/>We are the crackpots trying to disprove Vanstr. <text:s/>I mean, depending on what we uncover, we might need to bring someone in more familiar with like hacking things. <text:s/>But I </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T34">feel like we can wait to tell folks till after we get the super powers. <text:s/>It’ll make things a lot simpler on our end.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Yeah. <text:s/>I feel a bit bad about not letting folks know though.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“You are right. <text:s/>We could publish the data, and a way to contact us. <text:s/>Then anyone else could figure out what we have, and if they are smart enough to do so, we bring em in.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“That could work. <text:s/>Yeah, I like that a lot actually. <text:s/>If someone is curious or quick, they’ll be able to figure it out. <text:s/>We aren’t hiding the data, just the conclusions, which are still hypothetical at best.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T34"><text:tab/>“OK, I’ll contact one of the publishing places tomorrow morning. <text:s/>Should be able to get us into one of the smaller one’s at least.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35">Both got back to work for a bit, the Iefsh spoke up again.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T34"><text:tab/>“Babe, you ever wonder if we’re both just crackpots. <text:s/>We went from depressed this morning, to believing that we can hack reality in like five hours, just from looking at the 8</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T37">th</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T34"> number after the decimal in some experimental data. <text:s/>Sounds pretty crazy to me.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“I mean, yeah, we definitely have a tendency to jump to the big conclusions, but I think we are pretty good at grounding ourselves when we run into contradictory evidence. <text:s/>Goes with the whole ambition thing.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T34"><text:tab/>“Yeah, you’re right. <text:s/>… <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35">I love you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“I love you too.” <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"><text:span text:style-name="T35"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T36">Not three?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“Nope, just two. <text:s/>Can’t get dramatic now can we?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“I thought you did drama back in the day?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“Yeah, but I always ended up playing the emotionless scientist types. <text:s/>Never very good at emoting.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“I’m afraid I’d have to disagree there. <text:s/>You’re smile could blind someone.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“Only when I’m smiling at you. <text:s/>You are my emotion muse.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“I’ll add that to my resume. <text:s/>Iefsh Lazcht: <text:s/>Very a-muse-ing.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“I’d hire you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“Too late, I already hired you. <text:s/>Can’t both hire each other.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“You got it boss.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“Back to work. <text:s/>No slacking off!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“As you wish.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>The couple worked throughout the day, stopping only for short breaks here and there. <text:s/>They managed to uncover a few more leads as the day went on. <text:s/>Nothing as straightforward as what they had first discovered, but now that they were looking for the right sort of thing it was easier. <text:s/>They slept like the dead, and woke up refreshed and ready to go. <text:s/>Iefsh headed out to get some supplies they’d need to do some further experiments. <text:s/>Omth got a hold of some friends in the science journal publishing sphere, and then sent over the data. <text:s/>By noon the lovers were back at work, testing and figuring things out. <text:s/>Later that evening, a small, but well respected journal published a brief article going over the results of a recent experiment conducted by noted physicists Iefsh and Omth Lazcht. <text:s/>It was light on speculation, simply noting that these results had disproved a theory that Iefsh had proposed a number of years ago. <text:s/>The bulk of the article was simply data. <text:s/>The only thing particularly notable about the data was that the numbers were all presented to 15 decimals, while the journal’s editors usually rounded such data down to 6 places. <text:s/>A small note at the end indicated that the submitters of the article had requested this level of precision, and that any complaints or thoughts about the numbers should be directed at them, and not at the editing staff. <text:s/>A communication method was provided. <text:s/></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>Ryl Space(Ryl)</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Ryl’s body shook. <text:s/>They lurched out of the couch that they had left their body while they were gone. <text:s/>They moved quickly to the purification room, expelling excess nutrients, and cleansing their body. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T38">After a couple hundred seconds, they felt relatively normal again. <text:s/>It was always like this. <text:s/>Every time they jacked into a far off body, living as a perfect machine for kiloseconds at a time, they found returning to their frail, biological body, taxing. <text:s/>It was worse when the machine body was fresh, like this last time. <text:s/>Ryl had heard that many other explorers suffered next to none of these effects. <text:s/>They had been hesitant to discuss the symptoms with others, as they did not want to be considered unfit or incapable. <text:s/>The small amount of data about this kind of thing was not very comforting, with the trend being that the effects worsened over time, and that it either ended in an early retirement, or an attempted Departure. <text:s/>Ryl wondered if they too would fall prey to this. <text:s/>It was not that they hated their life back home. <text:s/>Quite the opposite. <text:s/>Ryl had friends, hobbies, and good relations with other explorers. <text:s/>And yet still, they knew that it was getting harder to come back. <text:s/>They felt less them, less there, when at home then when they were the machine, the explorer, the traveler. <text:s/>It was part of the reason that they’d had to leave when they did. <text:s/>They’d been keeping a strict schedule, not letting themselves get too comfortable in the other body. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:span text:style-name="T38"><text:tab/>Of course this time there was more than that. <text:s/>They were going to see one of their closest friends, and in the flesh. <text:s/>Such meetings were rare, formal events, and Ryl wanted themselves to be something perhaps not completely physically repellent. <text:s/>It wouldn’t change Sil’s opinion of them regardless, which was good to keep in mind, but it was still something Ryl wanted to do. <text:s/>It had been more than ten megaseconds since they had last greeted another of their own race in the flesh. <text:s/>In many ways the interactions with the denizens of the other spaces they explored were more “real” than those that they shared with their friends most days. <text:s/>The communication methods available these days were incredible for certain, but ultimately, they were designed to be easy to use, quick and painless. <text:s/>They didn’t put fidelity of experience above comfort, above safety, above ease of use. <text:s/>But explorers did. <text:s/>While their minds were still technically present in this place, those minds were connected, almost directly into the bodies in the other places. <text:s/>It was impossible to experience or control anything back home while one was away. <text:s/>Most explorers considered themselves truly in the places they explored. <text:s/>It was a hard thing to explain to those that had never done it though, and many thought of it more like playing a game, or chatting in a really good holoroom. <text:s/>Ryl knew they were wrong, but it was something difficult to put into words, and they rarely wanted to. <text:s/>Exploring was theirs, and they had little care if others chose to participate in it or not. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T39">And yet, now, it was time to communicate some of that experience, to interact with one of those who had never explored, never left the home space. <text:s/>It wasn’t something Ryl was comfortable with, really at all, but at least, Sil was about the best person for this kind of thing. <text:s/>There was no one that Ryl was more comfortable with. <text:s/>That wasn’t to say it would be comfortable, but perhaps it would not be entirely a disaster. <text:s/>But, no use contemplating, it was time to prepare.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T40">Ryl brought up a picture of their body. <text:s/>They turned it around, assessing how best to modify it to make it more presentable. <text:s/>First they adjusted lengths and widths, making themselves taller and shorter, with different limb lengths and thicknesses. <text:s/>Should they reflect their preferences, or try and present an image that might create good impression of explorers as a whole? <text:s/>What kind of message should that be, if they did want to take that into account? <text:s/>Should they seek to appear powerful in order to inspire confidence, or nonthreatening, in order to seem safe? <text:s/>Too many decisions for Ryl. <text:s/>They enjoyed the interactions with the sentient beings in the other spaces, yet somehow, when they came back home, the whole idea of discerning motives, and figuring out people’s wants seemed incredibly beyond them. <text:s/>All the extra layers in communication set down by a hundred thousand years of culture, supposedly making communication deeper and more meaningful, instead seemed like ghosts, creating a hundred tiny little </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T40">rituals, each one liked or hated, each one with slightly different meanings to slightly different people. <text:s/>Communication on the level of survival, of simply conveying meaning was beautiful, was intense. <text:s/>This thing that communication had become at home was not that at all. <text:s/>It was a behemoth, a massive thing of unbelievable complexity. <text:s/>Again, though, such thoughts didn’t get them any more ready. <text:s/>Decisions had to be made. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T41">They decided on a compromise, taking their typical thin, frail sort of frame, but adding just a hint of muscle, of shape, making themselves look capable, but hopefully not dangerous. <text:s/>With the basic shape down, they had to decide on a color scheme. <text:s/>They usually chose a monochomatic sorta of scheme, with mild variations in tone being the only differences between skin, and cloth, and hair. <text:s/>However, the world which they had just left inspired them. <text:s/>They took a different path, thinking of the sky which had so captured their imagination when first they had arrived in that new world. <text:s/>They modeled their colors after that sky. <text:s/>And last, they needed to pick the cloth, the clothing and accessories to cover the shape of their body. <text:s/>This was always the hardest part. <text:s/>There were simply too many options. <text:s/>Style was effectively a language, and one which, despite their general excellence in that department, Ryl was not very proficient. <text:s/>They tended to prefer large, layered clothing, when engaging in any sort of social interaction, wanting to add some level of defense or protection, even on a subconscious level. <text:s/>But to do so to the extent which they typically did, it would negate all the work they had done in deciding on a body shape, covering up the body, all but completely. <text:s/>They’d again have to step outside of their typical choices. <text:s/>Why were they doing this again? <text:s/>Something about saving their profession from cowardly reactionaries? <text:s/>Yeah, that was it. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:span text:style-name="T41"><text:tab/>Ryl had thought they’d managed to get themselves to forget why they were doing this whole thing. <text:s/>Pressure in a social situation was not something they dealt with well. <text:s/>If they were just talking and sharing, that was one thing. <text:s/>That might even be enjoyable on some level. <text:s/>But the idea that what they said, or worse, how they said it, might have an effect on their entire profession and by extension the capacity of their race to understand the universe on a fundamental level, was entirely outside what Ryl’s mind and body were really capable of. <text:s/>They left the floating picture of their body and returned to the purification room. <text:s/>Some additional nutrients were recycled and they stayed in there for while, trying to get a hold of themself. <text:s/>There body stilled, and Ryl felt capable of movement and decision making again. <text:s/>They returned to stare at the spinning picture of their body. <text:s/>A part of them wanted to wrap the thing in a half dozen layers and screw the consequences. <text:s/>Another part however was tired of all this. <text:s/>They knew that what they were doing was important. <text:s/>They needed to get this done, and they had no reason to fear because what they needed to get done was the right thing, the only way things could work. <text:s/>If a few less layers of cloth between them and another living being would make that reality more likely, then it was what they would have to do. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T42">Ryl closed their eyes, imagined the sky in the most recent space, and the skies in the dozens of previous spaces. <text:s/>They imagined it all, and then they imagined themselves in the midst of it all. <text:s/>And they wrapped themselves in it. <text:s/>Not tightly, not to cover themselves in it. <text:s/>No, instead they carried it, they wore the alien skies, bringing the skies with them, body and cloth supporting each other. <text:s/>Image formed in their mind, they sent it across the room at the little picture of their body, and the computers began interpreting, turning that thought into a physically possible, corporeal thing. <text:s/>As that work was being done, Ryl once again dealt with calming their body and mind. <text:s/>Both processes seemed to take similar amount of times, and they stepped confidently across the room, scanned the completed image of themselves, and after a moment nodded. <text:s/>They passed the image to the purification chamber, and for the third time in less than a kilosecond, entered the chamber. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T42">Ryl always managed to forget just how disconcerting it was to be conscious through this process. <text:s/>They watched as their skin and muscle were stripped away, then forged anew. <text:s/>It wasn’t supposed to be painful, but somehow the act of seeing it, made it so. <text:s/>The lasers moved over each part of the body, taking it apart and putting it back together in the specified form. <text:s/>Then, once the body was complete, the clothing was forged, crafted from the clouds of molecules which swirled around them, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T42">each bit put together one by one, made to an exacting precision not fully appreciable. <text:s/>The sky was turned into clothing, and that clothing was affixed to Ryl. <text:s/>Body prepared, they exited the chamber, resetting it back to its base function so that they would not accidentally end up reforging their bodies again if they came back and didn&apos;t think about it. <text:s/>Their body was ready. <text:s/>Now for their mind.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T43">This step was more straightforward than the body bit. <text:s/>Ryl knew what they needed to make this work. <text:s/>There were elements of their personality that needed to be changed if they were going to have a hope of convincing anyone of anything. <text:s/>But of course Ryl was fond of Ryl, and so it was important to ensure that the changes one makes will make one into a person that wants to return to being the person that they were before the changes. <text:s/>Ryl had of course made mistakes in doing this in their life, and you rarely ended up returning exactly to who you were before you changed your mind, but in general it was not that hard once proper motivations were created. <text:s/>They checked the routines, made sure everything was set as normal, selected the appropriate personality adjustments, and activated. <text:s/>They felt disoriented for a moment, and then they were no longer Ryl, but rather someone very similar to Ryl, who would, after this particular situation was resolved, endeavor to become once again, Ryl. <text:s/>With this step done, all was in order. <text:s/>Not-Ryl walked towards their little used exit. <text:s/>They passed through the membrane, entered the travel pod, and entered the appropriate coordinates. <text:s/>The little pod detached from the greater pod which was Ryl’s home, and sped through the void, towards the home of Sil, friend, diplomat, and current leader of the largest group of discontented citizens in a gigasecond. <text:s/>Space folded, and the pod was there. <text:s/>It slowed, docked, and Not-Ryl walked inside Sil’s pod.</text:span></text:p>
