   <text:p text:style-name="P1"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:tab/>The sky was the color of a sweet breakfast cereal. <text:s/>It was vivid in a way that nothing at home was. <text:s/>Well mostly nothing at least. <text:s/>It was the first thing Ryl noticed as their eyes became functional. <text:s/>So many places had the same dusty clouds, or orange haze. <text:s/>Ryl knew it came from how they found these places, that the way the sky looked had a lot to do with what the sky was made of, and what the sky was made of had a lot to do with whether they could find it. <text:s/>As Ryl considered this, they redoubled their observation. <text:s/>How had they ended up in this technicolor sort of place then? <text:s/>What had made this place stick out, brought an observer all the way to this place? <text:s/>Nothing immediately sprung to mind. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T1">Then, a few more of their sensory organs started working as well. <text:s/>It then became apparent what had stuck out about this space, how this incredible sky had been found. <text:s/>The place was loud. <text:s/>Not in a sonic sense, though Ryl had yet to start thinking about that sense, but rather when it came to less organic types of signals. <text:s/>On every frequency and amplitude possible the place was abuzz. <text:s/>It was almost too much for it to be from a living source. <text:s/>Surely no species could understand anything in this deafening roar of signals. <text:s/>They’d have thought them just noise, and would have filed this away as a place unknown to sentient beings, except that each individual bit of the noise seemed so much like a signal. <text:s/>It didn’t feel random. <text:s/>It was patterned. <text:s/>It was everyone talking at once, in a hundred different languages. <text:s/>Ryl began logging the input on those senses, but pushed it away from their consciousness. <text:s/>It was too much for now. <text:s/>Better to focus on the sky, really see that, then look around in a more conventional manner. <text:s/>So Ryl looked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"><text:tab/>The basis of it was blue, but a richer and more vivid blue than any Ryl had seen before. <text:s/>And it was not just blue. <text:s/>As if the sky was painted, there were streaks of other colors. <text:s/>Some might have been clouds, but they seemed too solid, and yet too strangely shaped to be ships or flying things. <text:s/>Bright oranges, pinks, and acid greens stretched across the blue canvas, just massive ribbons of color in the sky. <text:s/>And then even more colors dotted between these stripes, little flecks of metallic looking colors. Perhaps artificial fliers? <text:s text:c="2"/>Before Ryl could observe further however, their attention was pulled downward, to movement nearby on the ground. <text:s/>They had not looked down since they had gained the ability to see, so captured had they been by the sky, so when at last they were forced to look down, it was very hard to understand what was going on. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/>Though never having experienced insects in their home space, somehow a deep primeval part of Ryl’s mind still searched for and recoiled from such creatures. <text:s/>In every such space where they had been present, Ryl had done their very best to avoid interactions or even much observation of such creatures. <text:s/>And so it was, that Ryl’s <text:span text:style-name="T2">immediate</text:span> thought upon turning their gaze down to the ground level, was panic. <text:s/>Their was a lot of very small things moving around, a lot of things that appeared to be webs, and the limbs of Ryl’s <text:span text:style-name="T2">preferred</text:span> body appeared to be being invaded by a large number of crawling creatures. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T2">And so it was to Ryl’s credit that they did not immediately begin flailing about and crushing the tiny things that continued to coat the outside of their body. <text:s/>Instead they watched, just as they had watched the sky. <text:s/>The skittering things were not coating the body in its entirety, just passing over all of it in a wave. <text:s/>Probably some way of scanning. <text:s/>Ryl focused in on the critters, getting a clearer look as other data was set aside. <text:s/>It became readily apparent that these creatures were definitely not organic. <text:s/>They were uniform and looked constructed. <text:s/>And so Ryl straitened out, making sure not to crush any of the little robots, and checked the status of body self construction, wanting to see if their body would change again after the scanning was complete or if the little guys would get an accurate picture of Ryl’s body. <text:s/>Turned out the rest of the body creation was internal, so Ryl hoped they could avoid surprising whoever might be controlling the little bots. <text:s/>While waiting for the bot-bugs to finish, Ryl turned their attention to the things that had appeared so much like webs. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T3">Thin and wispy the things were indeed very web-like. <text:s/>A quick use of the same senses that had made the sky so disorienting soon indicated that the web things were also used for communication. <text:s/></text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T3">Signals flowed through the cords, at a rate and volume that Ryl found incredible. <text:s/>It was always difficult to really understand scale in each new space, but there were more than a thousand layers of these webs between them and the ground, and each layer seemed packed with more connections and conversations than an entire species might want to have in a year. <text:s/>Ryl was again forced to push these senses back in their mind, lest they become overwhelmed. <text:s/>Could they even walk in this world, or were the webs so ubiquitous that no one here moved, simply passing information via this massive network of cables, serviced by the little nano-bugs? <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">Ryl decided to test this out. <text:s/>The bug things appeared to be trying to attach some of the webbing to Ryl’s body and they decided it would be good to see how moving would work before they became incapable of it. <text:s/>Ryl double checked all the limbs were in working conditions, then took a gentle step forward. <text:s/>To their surprise, the webs parted around them. <text:s/>They took another step and the same thing happened. <text:s/>It was incredible. <text:s/>These webs were all weaved together in a thousand thousand ways, and yet they appeared to be able to accommodate arbitrary movement without any of them breaking. <text:s/>Ryl decided to test this hypothesis and began to run. <text:s/>They were fearful of crushing the little creatures or tearing the webbing, and yet somehow neither of those things happened. <text:s/>Everything seemed to flow around Ryl’s body, and their was no friction, just a gentle feeling of moving through a warm breeze. <text:s/>Ryl enjoyed this sensation for a short while, moving through the environment, and feeling the threads move around them, watching as they moved and stretched and never broke. <text:s/>Ryl could not for the life of them figure out how this was working. <text:s/>They focused in on one thread and kept moving. <text:s/>As they stepped forward, it stretched and it stretched. <text:s/>Then it somehow slipped around Ryl’s legs. <text:s/>Ryl stopped, looking back. <text:s/>Had they stepped over one of the sources of the thread? <text:s/>Had they simply stepped over the thread at some point, or had it been pulled down below their feet by another thread? <text:s/>It was impossible to tell the threads apart in the mess of complexity below their feet. <text:s/>Ryl shook their head and decided it was time to start exploring proper. <text:s/>They only had a few more minutes for the day. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">Ryl once again shifted the scope of their attention. <text:s/>Instead of focusing only on the sky, or the webs, or the nano-bots that continued to be constructing something on their body, Ryn extended their senses out more generally, taking in the environment as a whole, trying to get an idea of if there were population centers or some sign of activity aside from the relentless communication in the webs and in the sky. <text:s/>This middle, between the ground and sky, was just as engaging as the other two extremes had been. <text:s/>The horizon was curved strangely. <text:s/>It seemed likely that this space was not a planet or at least not a spherical one. <text:s/>The horizon itself seemed almost knotted, in the same way that the webbing below did. <text:s/>Looking at one place, you could follow with your eyes how it met another spot. <text:s/>And yet no where did either of those two spots cross over some parts of the intervening horizon. <text:s/>Ryl had been to a few places with geometries different than that of home, but never any so blatantly bizarre. <text:s/>It was hard to believe this place could be self consistent. <text:s/>And yet it certainly was. <text:s/>The knotted wire flowed around things, and the horizons touched without moving. <text:s/>But again, Ryl was focusing on the specifics. <text:s/>Only six more minutes to figure something about this place out. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">Ryl did their best to scan the area, not stopping on any one thing too long. <text:s/>They noticed the tall spikes that seemed a cross between a neon tree and a street light. <text:s/>They observed shapes underneath the fog of webbing, domes and pyramids and boxes. <text:s/>It was hard to tell much about them besides the shapes though because of the sheer amount of webbing that covered these places. <text:s/>Indeed, the ground itself was difficult to see, even the bit that Ryl was currently stepping on. <text:s/>The gliding sorta of walk they had initially started using because of their fear of harming the bots or the webs now served them well in that it allowed them to feel the ground as they moved, not having to rely on their eyes to figure out the ground. <text:s/>Thus far they had not encountered any pits, holes, or spikes, but it paid to be careful. <text:s/>It was while they were considering this that they encountered the one thing that they had been banking on to help them out. <text:s/>They saw movement. <text:s/>Though they could not spot the source of the movement, they saw its effects in the ripple of the wires. <text:s/>A goal observed, Ryl glided on an intercept course with the ripples in the web. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">After only a few moments of this course, it seemed that Ryl had been observed by their quarry, as the ripple too began changing course, turning in Ryl’s direction. <text:s/>This brightened Ryl’s mood, as chasing things was rarely good for relationships with said thing. <text:s/>It was always much easier to communicate with the curious then it was the fearful. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">At around the twenty meter distance, Ryl was finally able to see the source of the rippling. <text:s/>Honestly it was less bizarre than Ryl had been expecting based on the level of weird they had already observed here. <text:s/>It looked like a very large, bipedal, version of an animal that Ryl had once seen back in home space. <text:s/>It had a long face, a checkered shell thing, and whiskers. <text:s/>Or at least they seemed like whiskers. <text:s/>It soon became apparent that the whiskers never ended, instead continuing out and around becoming part of the web that surrounded everything. <text:s/>This being was physically connected to the vast network which surrounded them. <text:s/>It has eyes and a big nose as well, but these were apparently not as effective as Ryl’s as the creature didn’t seem to really see Ryl until they were only a few meters away. <text:s/>At which point both stopped, and stared. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T4">Ryl started by trying words, but if the creature heard their voice, it didn’t respond at all. <text:s/>The creature held up a three fingered hand, and began to sign. <text:s/>Ryl observed and noticed it was repeating a small number of symbols over and over again. <text:s/>Likely simple numbers. <text:s/>Taking a few guesses about biology and upbringing, Ryl took a guess, and compared it against a host of constants that they knew, fundamental constants of the universe that one might use when attempting to find common ground with an alien being. <text:s/>Nothing matched up well. <text:s/>Ryl took another guess, and tried again, and still found nothing. <text:s/>They tried a couple more times before deciding that this might not be what the being was trying to say. <text:s/>Would a random citizen of a space like this know those constants off the top of their head anyways? <text:s/>Ryl was an explorer, and interacted with other species regularly, so they were fundamental to how they communicated, but this wasn’t a scientist or a diplomat, this was just a random member of this species. <text:s/>They were make some repeating symbols with their hands. <text:s/>And yet it seemed very likely that they primarily used their whisker webs to communicate. <text:s/>Wait, that was it. <text:s/>Ryl shifted attention from vision to the spectrum which could feel the messages traveling down the mass of wires. <text:s/>Specifically they focused on the wires the tiny bots had affixed to their body. <text:s/>And their it was. <text:s/>The same pattern being sent down a wire. <text:s/>Or rather two wires. <text:s/>Input and output. <text:s/>And then they had communication. <text:s/>Neither yet understood the other’s language, but by sending and receiving electric impulses along the two wires, communication itself was possible. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T5">A rapid series of communications established some basic methods of communication, getting the numbers across, and then using that and some pointing to start creating some basic syntax with which to communicate. <text:s/>Ryl zeroed in on trying to get across an idea of time, and a way of communicating something like sleep. <text:s/>And with only a few seconds to spare, Ryl did just that, and sent one last message. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T6">Sleep for 40000 seconds.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P5"><text:span text:style-name="T10"><text:tab/>A bolt of lightning almost struck Tazkia as she advanced. <text:s/>She had managed to juke out of the way, and having done so, she knew the fight was over. <text:s/>She closed the last of the distance, taking little damage from her foes remaining attacks, now that the lightning was out of the way. <text:s/>Once she was in range, she unleashed her own magicks, blasting the bearded, lightning throwing, wizard into oblivion. <text:s/>With the lightning mage out of the way, Tazkia led her forces through the gap, knocking down enemy battlements, and at last, after one more quick skirmish, destroying the giant crystalline structure which served as her foes’ main base. <text:s/>She quickly typed, “gg”, then took her hands off the keyboard as the screen flashed “victory” and the post game stats showed up. <text:s/>When the stats came up, the game changed from full screen to windowed, and Tazkia glanced down at the time, wincing when she saw it. <text:s/>She had class in less than 4 hours, and still hadn’t touched her math assignment. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T11">She could probably get it done in half an hour and manage at least three hours of sleep. <text:s/>As she thought about this, and started recalling what exactly she’d learned about in math last Friday, she clicked through some menu’s and took a look at her rankings after tonight’s games. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"><text:span text:style-name="T11"><text:tab/>She’d gone up more than a few places in the rankings. <text:s/>She felt pretty good about this, but then she noticed who was right above her. <text:s/>Maybe she could get the math homework done after her morning class? <text:s/>If she only played one more game she’d still get like two hours of sleep. <text:s/>Yeah, she never took the whole two hours for her labs anyways, so she’d finish early, and have time to do the math homework no problem. <text:s/>With one more win she’d officially have the highest rank in her school, and the look on everyone’s faces at the LAN tomorrow night would be worth the sleep deprivation. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T12">She clicked too queue up for another game, but just as she did so, she got an invite to join someone else’s game. <text:s/>She got a ton of invites from folks she didn’t know since she was one of the highest ranking player’s in the country, and she usually ignored them, but this one made her pause. <text:s/>It was the name. <text:s/>Not too many other folks played with Muslim user names, and almost none of those that did were girls. <text:s/>Yet here was someone named Safeerah, inviting her to a game. <text:s/>She checked this person’s rank, figuring it was probably someone pretty low. <text:s/>She wasn’t in the mood to try and coach anyone through the game. <text:s/>But no, this person wasn’t low rank. <text:s/>She wasn’t quite as high as Tazkia, but the next best rank. <text:s/>Intrigued, she clicked accept, dropping out of her solo search and joining up with “Safeerah”. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"><text:tab/>Maybe it was another high ranking player just screwing with her with a name change? <text:s/>Best to check. </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P8"><text:span text:style-name="T13"><text:tab/>Too quick to be google translate. <text:s/>This gal was legit. <text:s/>Tazkia smiled. <text:s/>She was glad she’d decided on one more game. <text:s/>She’d tried to get some of the girl’s on her floor to play a couple times, but it never worked out very well. <text:s/>And she liked playing with the guys, but still, this was kinda cool too. <text:s/>She didn’t ask any more questions, not wanting to seem as intrigued by her gaming partner as she actually was, and soon they were selecting characters for the game, together with a few more randomly selected players. <text:s/>Tazkia managed to work up the courage to ask Safeerah if she wanted to play together in the same part of the map. <text:s/>The mysterious girl agreed and after a quick discussion with the other players, and a short loading screen, they were walking together to their designated sect</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T15">or. <text:s/>They waited together for shock troops from both sides to lumber their way to the half way point of the map, so that the fighting could begin. <text:s/>Then they played.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"><text:span text:style-name="T15"><text:tab/>Safeera was solid. <text:s/>Nothing exceptional, but very efficient. <text:s/>Always took the high probability plays, never made mistakes, and always seemed to get timings down really well. <text:s/>This worked well together with Tazkia’s more aggressive, riskier, style, and the two quickly gained some big advantages </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T15">against the opponents in that part of the map. <text:s/>Unfortunately, the rest of her team was not doing as well. <text:s/>While she and Safeera were taking a solid lead, everyone else was down one or two kills. <text:s/>It looked likely that it was going to be one of those games where she did well, did her part, but still lost the game because her companions couldn’t hack it. <text:s/>She tried to untilt her </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T16">teammates, pointing out her own lead, and promising to carry them if they could just hold on out, but one of them was getting angry, and Tazkia was pretty sure the game was about to spiral out of control. <text:s/>She sighed. <text:s/>These things happen. <text:s/>Would have been nice to take the crown for tomorrow, but there is always another day. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"><text:tab/>Still, winning was possible, so she steeled herself for a long drawn out game. <text:s/>If she and Safeera could keep their lead, then they might be able to make something happen in the late game, so long as they kept calm. <text:s/>It was a long shot, but its what she had. <text:s/>Then:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P25"><text:tab/>Cautiously optimistic, Tazkia followed her new friend towards the center of the game world, where the enemy team had grouped up, taking advantage of her own team’s weakness in that area. <text:s/>As they got close, Tazkia wondered what the plan was. <text:s/>There was no way they could win two versus five. <text:s/>They would be throwing the game to even try. <text:s/>Still, her companion seemed confident. <text:s/>They got to one of their own buildings, just as the enemy advanced with its forces. <text:s/>Time to run. <text:s/>But the girl didn’t run, and Tazkia, despite her plan to play smart, play cautious, stayed with her. <text:s/>Time slowed down. <text:s/>At first Tazkia thought this was just adrenaline, but she soon realized that this was too slow. <text:s/>The enemies were moving like molasses, and she had all the time in the world to dodge each of their strikes, firing her own into the perfect spots. <text:s/>In a battle which, Tazkia knew from experience, should have taken about ten seconds, she and Safeera took five slow minutes, methodically destroying the enemy team. <text:s/>Then, once the last foe had fallen, time seemed to return to normal, and the two of them captured the enemies forward base. <text:s/>The game wasn’t over yet, but that fight had shifted the tempo and the advantage completely. <text:s/>There was a few short seconds of silence over chat, then both her allies and her enemies exploded into disbelieving exclamations. <text:s/></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P27"><text:tab/>“What the hell?” said Tazkia sharply, then quickly glanced over at her roommate, making sure she was still asleep. <text:s/>She checked her phone. <text:s/>Same time. <text:s/>She slip her chair quietly over to her roommate’s desk and checked her alarm and her computer clock. <text:s/>All confirmed the same time. <text:s/>It was midnight. <text:s/>It had been 4 or 5 am a few minutes ago. <text:s/>Had she dreamed the whole thing? <text:s/>That would make more sense. <text:s/>Better check my games played. <text:s/>She tried to log into the game. <text:s/></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P28"><text:tab/>She laid down, not bothering to set the alarm after all since she wasn’t going to be able to sleep for seven hours straight anyways. <text:s/>She started to drift off. <text:s/>“At least I can say that I won all those games tonight in my sleep,” she thought, smiling a bit. <text:s/>Then she was out. <text:s/>A little over four hours later her computer woke from its sleep, the game open, with one final message.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:tab/>An empty blackness. <text:s/>Yasmit jumped. <text:s/>An empty whiteness. <text:s/>Yasmit jumped again. <text:s/>A patterned blue and redness. <text:s/>He spent a few minutes looking at the pattern, trying to see any meaning in it. <text:s/>He got it after a few minutes and jumped again. <text:s/>Ooh, this one looked like it had physics. <text:s/>Stars were visible in the distance. <text:s/>Yasmit adjusted the settings, jumping from place to place in this space instead of too an entirely new one. <text:s/>He skipped towards stars, cutting the distance in half with each jump until he was close enough to scan for planets or anything interesting. <text:s/>When he found nothing of interest, he moved to the next star, then the next. <text:s/>After a half dozen or so attempts he stopped, did some quick math, then simply jumped directly to the nearest hundred stars for a half second apiece. <text:s/>Saw some color in one. <text:s/>Jumped back a few steps. <text:s/>Zoomed in towards the colorful planet. <text:s/>Scanned it for signs of life. <text:s/>Nothing. <text:s/>Boring. <text:s/>Guess the chemistry is kinda cool. <text:s/>Slightly different elements here. <text:s/>Wait, better check ramifications of that. <text:s/>Damn. <text:s/>Chemistry doesn’t support life here. <text:s/>Next space. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:span text:style-name="T13"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T21">This one was trippy. <text:s/>Glowy balls of skittering colors. <text:s/>Echoing cosmic sounds. <text:s/>Twisting plant things that all seemed to be holding hands. <text:s/>Maybe a bit too random to be likely to contain life, but worth checking out all the same. <text:s/>Yasmit’s scanners screeched. <text:s/>Ah, looks like its a bit too random to support my life too. <text:s/>Too bad. <text:s/>Yasmit jumped again. <text:s/>Another freakin’ empty blackness. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T22">He jumped again. <text:s/>Empty blackness. <text:s/>Again. <text:s/>Whiteness. <text:s/>Blackness… white, white, black, black, white, black… Ooh, colors. <text:s/>Just two back and forth though. <text:s/>Pattern holds across all of space. <text:s/>Once more into the breech my friends. <text:s/>He jumped again.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"><text:span text:style-name="T13"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T21">Yasmit stopped for a while in the next space. <text:s/>It was another empty whiteness. <text:s/>Slightly less common then empty blackness, which seemed strange to him, but it was undeniable based on the data he’d gathered. <text:s/>He was tired of jumping though. <text:s/>Time to take a quick break. <text:s/>He rested his eyes, letting his scanners figure out what exactly he could do in this place. <text:s/>Wait, wasn’t the color just a construct in his own mind. <text:s/>Maybe he just liked black better? <text:s/>No, that’s not how that works. <text:s/>There is some consistency to all the black places that makes them different then all the white places. <text:s/>Maybe another person would see the white as black and the black as white, but it still doesn’t change the fact that one of them is more common then the other which was still weird. <text:s/>He always thought he should study some physics, but when it was so different in each place, it always felt kinda wasteful. <text:s/>Maybe he was just lazy though. <text:s/>There was a lot that was consistent between spaces. <text:s/>Seemed like certain things made existence much more likely. <text:s/>Or maybe were just assumptions built into the spaces? <text:s/>That’s a thought. <text:s/>Could there be biases inbuilt into the spaces? <text:s/>There had to be. <text:s/>Other folks probably already thought about this. <text:s/>Ooh, scanning finished. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31"><text:tab/>Not too much to work with, but Yasmit could make some kind of a change. <text:s/>If some other explorer found this place in a few septillion years, they’d be met with a white, almost emptiness. <text:s/>Working with the forces that his scanners had detected, Yasmit began to create, to make color out of the white space. <text:s/>He’d been planning a whole big sorta portrait thing, but it turned out that making a few centimeters of stuff took like twenty seconds, so that was out. <text:s/>After about a half an hour of creating then moving around, Yasmit was happy with his creation. <text:s/>He looked at some of his other options presented on the scanner, and made sure this space would draw attention should someone happen by. <text:s/>This done, he jumped, leaving the whiteness. <text:s/>The emptiness however was gone, replaced by:</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T26"><text:tab/>A soft but repetitive beeping indicated that the machine was ready. <text:s/>Omth looked at Iefsh. <text:s/>She nodded after a moment, both of them sharing a moment before the pair stepped away from the machine itself and sat down at the two computer terminals on both sides. <text:s/>This was the big moment. <text:s/>They’d both bet everything on Iefth’s theory. <text:s/>And after four years of research and work, they were finally at the point where her theories would be detectabl</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T27">y</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T26"> different than the accepted model. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T27">No one else had thought this area even worth considering, so confident where they in the theories of the genius, Vanstr, hero of modern science, and savior of the world. <text:s/>Now Vanstr was undeniably a genius, but they could still be wrong. <text:s/>They’d come further than anyone else, but that doesn’t mean that there is not further to go. <text:s/>Iefsh had seen another way, another possibility and Omth had had faith in her vision. <text:s/>Now of course, they’d also been madly in love, which tended to affect one’s beliefs a bit, but still. <text:s/>She was every bit as much of a genius as Vanstr and Omth was going to help prove it. <text:s/>This was going to be the proof they needed, the first step in explaining the world from a perspective of </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T28">fractal reality, as opposed to the irreducible particles and interactions that Vanstr claimed were the basics of the world they lived in. <text:s/>Just a flipped switch and twenty minutes of observation away. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“You ready for this babe?” asked Iefsh. <text:s/>She reached over the machine, her hand out. <text:s/>Omth took the outstretched hand and squeezed, then just held on. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“Not really, but more ready than I likely ever will be. <text:s/>Never been good with the big moments.” <text:s/>Iefsh laughed. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“No, you definitely never have been. <text:s/>I love you still though.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“Figured. <text:s/>I imagine if you were too put off by that, we probably wouldn’t have lasted this long.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“Maybe I just needed a lab assistant that wouldn’t argue with me too much?” <text:s/>Omth raised an eyebrow. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“Somehow I suspect there are more direct methods for that. <text:s/>A half decade of happy marriage is perhaps a bit roundabout for some extra help.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“Ya got me. <text:s/>I married you for the help in the lab, and because I think you are hot.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"><text:tab/>“Can’t ask for much more than that.” <text:s/>The two stared at each other some more, an activity the pair tended to enjoy a great deal. <text:s/>Then together, they both looked down at the machine. <text:s/>Wordlessly, Omth ran the scanning program on his terminal. <text:s/>Meanwhile, Iefsh stood up, walked over to the machine, and flipped the overly large power switch. <text:s/>The beeping went silent and the table sized chunk of hardware began purring softly. <text:s/>She sat down, and they both began staring down at the incoming data, rapt. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T28"><text:tab/>A stranger in the room would have barely been able to notice any facial expression change on the pair as they sat still, eyes locked on their screens for twenty minutes, not making a sound. <text:s/>But if either of them had been looking at the other, they would have seen the change. <text:s/>Curiosity and hope turning slowly, every so slowly, into </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T29">resignation and something close to despair. <text:s/>For a long time after the machine stopped humming, neither moved at all. <text:s/>Eventually Omth stood up and walked over to Iefsh. <text:s/>He touched her, and she shot up. <text:s/>They both held each other, and after a stretch of silence, they both began to cry. <text:s/>They hugged and cried and eventually left the lab, walked into their kitchen, and started preparing the food they had set aside for today. <text:s/>It had been going to be a celebration. <text:s/>Instead it was some way of filling the void, of not thinking about all the years of work that had been for not. <text:s/>They ate, and they drank, and they cried, and they made out, and then they went to bed, and fell asleep. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T29"><text:tab/>Omth woke up later than he usually did. <text:s/>He felt cozy and happy, his general base state after he got used to the fact that he was a married man. <text:s/>Then he remembered the previous night and everything seemed to fall away. <text:s/>He could feel by the lack of warmth in the bed that Iefsh was already up. <text:s/>This was unusual, as she usually woke him before she got up, or just waited, watching him sleep till he got </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T29">up. <text:s/>But, she wasn’t there. <text:s/>He shook off the impulse to just sink back into sleep and forget about the whole mess. <text:s/>If he was feeling this bad, then she had to be feeling worse. <text:s/>It had been her idea that was dispelled last night. <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T30">He shook his head a couple times, rolled out of bed, snagged some clothes from the ground where he had taken them off the previous night, then lurched out of the room, in search of his wife.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>He found her where he expected to find her, in the lab room. <text:s/>There she was, sitting at the terminal, staring at the numbers again, the machine humming. <text:s/>Considering the scale of what they were dealing with, the chances of a repeat experiment being noticeably different was infinitesimal, but he figured she’d try again anyways. <text:s/>What was another 20 minutes of disappointment compared to the hope of maybe, just maybe, it being a mistake? <text:s/>He started walking towards his own chair on the opposite side of the machine, ready to be there, to go through the data again. <text:s/>If this was what would help Iefsh deal with this, then he’d do his part. <text:s/>When he sat down however, he actually looked at his wife’s face. <text:s/>What he saw there was not at all what he had been expecting. <text:s/>Wonder. <text:s/>Curiosity. <text:s/>Discovery. <text:s/>Had last night been some kind of terrible anti-miracle? <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"><text:tab/>Omth considered the data on his terminal, looking for any differences from last night. <text:s/>Nothing. <text:s/>Was Iefsh fooling herself? <text:s/>Was she seeing something that wasn’t there? <text:s/>Or was she seeing something that he couldn’t see or hadn’t considered? <text:s/>Considering his wife, it was the later proposition that seemed a lot more likely. <text:s/>She’d never been one to deny that which she could see with her own eyes. <text:s/>If she was excited by something in the data, then there was something exciting there. <text:s/>He could go over there and see what it was, or he could try and find it for himself as well. <text:s/>Well, his wife was the better scientist, but he was one himself too. <text:s/>Clearing his mind, putting aside everything he had assumed about this experiment, he looked at the data again. <text:s/>Not just the bits that had so interested him that previous night, the bits that would prove or disprove Iefsh’s theory, but instead tried to look at everything. <text:s/>That bit had turned out to support Vanstr’s theories, but maybe some of the other data points, which they had not really been thinking about, where off, where different than expected. <text:s/>Some sort of hope now glowing inside him again, he poured himself into the work.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T30"><text:tab/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T31">Omth was unsure how much time had passed when he finally pushed himself away from the terminal, rolling his chair away from the screen. <text:s/>His mind was abuzz. <text:s/>What could it mean? <text:s/>How did that make sense at all? <text:s/>He glanced up. <text:s/>His wife was pacing back and forth, her eyes up, mumbling to herself. <text:s/>He’d seen it, now was the time for collaboration. <text:s/>He got up. <text:s/>Iefsh zoomed over to him, pulling him into a long kiss, one he had not been ready for, resulting in a deep inhale when at last she let him go. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“You got it?” she asked, all smiles and wonder.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Yeah, though I don’t understand why at all. <text:s/>I’m so confused.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Yeah, me too. <text:s/>What a weird algorithm. <text:s/>I mean, its pretty dang random, but still predictable if you get a hold of some data.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Yeah, who would have thought the universe r- … wait? <text:s/>Random? <text:s/>Are we talking about the same thing?” <text:s/>His wife raised both eyebrows.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“You saw that the data on the particles was following a pattern that wasn’t truly random, that it was some kinda psuedo-random number generator?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Umm… no.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Wait… <text:s/>what did you see then?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36"><text:tab/>“Umm… particle collision math isn’t perfectly accurate. <text:s/>It’s precise up to a point, but it rounds or something after a certain level of precision.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T31"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">The universe is rounding? <text:s/>When its subatomic particles collide its freakin’ rounding?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“And its also picking random things in a non-random way?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“We should double check each other. <text:s/>I’ll give you the algorithm I figured out, and you show me where the math doesn’t add up.” <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T32"><text:tab/>“Alright.” <text:s/>The pair set to work, working together, checking each other’s assumptions, running numbers and comparing arithmetic. <text:s/>They worked for another couple hours, then, drawn by the siren song of their stomach’s, retired to the kitchen, reheating leftovers from the previous night. <text:s/>Scarfing was the appropriate word to describe their interactions with the food. <text:s/>Iefsh was about to speak, but O</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T34">m</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T32">th stopped her, motioning towards the restroom. <text:s/>After he returned, they spoke.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“You know what this means?” asked Iefsh. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“Um… not exactly. <text:s/>Guess it makes the world feel a lot more ‘manufactured’ to some extent? <text:s/>Like engineers cut corners when they made everything.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“Which means this place was made.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“Wait, like by a god or something?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"><text:tab/>“Technically possible I guess, but I’m figuring something less religion, and more computer science.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T32"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T33">Oh. <text:s/>Like the whole, “we live in a simulation” idea that was so popular back during the advent of computers?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Precisely. <text:s/>Or rather, not precisely, which is the whole point.” <text:s/>Iefsh grinned.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“OK, so we live in a simulation. <text:s/>Does that fundamentally change anything really? <text:s/>I feel like the fact that it didn’t is why people eventually stopped talking about it.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“It doesn’t change anything really if there is no way for the simulation to interact with anything outside it. <text:s/>If we are in perfectly contained simulation, its exactly the same as us not being in a simulation except that some folks we can never experience or understand could presumably turn us off or screw with us in some way. <text:s/>But… that assumes that the simulation is created in a perfectly safe way. <text:s/>Both of the things we discovered today imply imperfection. <text:s/>If we can detect the raggedy edges of our simulation, or raggedy structure, then maybe we can find some other parts that have some flaws?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Are you implying we either figure out how to hack reality? <text:s/>Like gain super powers and stuff?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Oh, I guess we could do that too. <text:s/>That could be pretty fun. <text:s/>I was more thinking about escaping it. <text:s/>If we’ve found the edges of our reality, why not explore the reality that built this one?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Grand ambitions. <text:s/>They’re why I married you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“I thought it was because I look great in skirts and helped you finish your thesis?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“Baby, you look great in anything. <text:s/>Also in nothing. <text:s/>Plus I was going to get my thesis done regardless. <text:s/>You just cut a few months off.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:tab/>“I cut a year off at least.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T33"><text:tab/>“Fair. <text:s/>But the grand ambitions were also pretty hot.” <text:s/>Iefsh </text:span><text:span text:style-name="T34">gives Omth a kiss and then holds out her hand to him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Want to hack reality with me? <text:s/>For science, and discovery, and also maybe super powers?” <text:s/>Omth takes the hand, and drags Iefsh close, kissing her back and wrapping her in his arms. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Sounds like a plan darling. <text:s/>When do we start?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Maybe in an hour?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“OK.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“You doing anything for the next hour?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Nope, not much going on.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Excellent.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>An hour and a half later, the pair were back in the lab. <text:s/>They’d decided to check for any more flaws in the same vein as the first couple they’d found. <text:s/>They worked quietly, jotting down anything interesting that they found and passing notes via paper airplane. <text:s/>Then Iefsh spoke.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“We going to tell anyone about this?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T34"><text:tab/>“Would anyone believe us? <text:s/>We are the crackpots trying to disprove Vanstr. <text:s/>I mean, depending on what we uncover, we might need to bring someone in more familiar with like hacking things. <text:s/>But I </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T34">feel like we can wait to tell folks till after we get the super powers. <text:s/>It’ll make things a lot simpler on our end.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“Yeah. <text:s/>I feel a bit bad about not letting folks know though.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“You are right. <text:s/>We could publish the data, and a way to contact us. <text:s/>Then anyone else could figure out what we have, and if they are smart enough to do so, we bring em in.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“That could work. <text:s/>Yeah, I like that a lot actually. <text:s/>If someone is curious or quick, they’ll be able to figure it out. <text:s/>We aren’t hiding the data, just the conclusions, which are still hypothetical at best.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T34"><text:tab/>“OK, I’ll contact one of the publishing places tomorrow morning. <text:s/>Should be able to get us into one of the smaller one’s at least.” <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35">Both got back to work for a bit, the Iefsh spoke up again.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T34"><text:tab/>“Babe, you ever wonder if we’re both just crackpots. <text:s/>We went from depressed this morning, to believing that we can hack reality in like five hours, just from looking at the 8</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T37">th</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T34"> number after the decimal in some experimental data. <text:s/>Sounds pretty crazy to me.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:tab/>“I mean, yeah, we definitely have a tendency to jump to the big conclusions, but I think we are pretty good at grounding ourselves when we run into contradictory evidence. <text:s/>Goes with the whole ambition thing.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T34"><text:tab/>“Yeah, you’re right. <text:s/>… <text:s/></text:span><text:span text:style-name="T35">I love you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>“I love you too.” <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"><text:span text:style-name="T35"><text:tab/>“</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T36">Not three?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“Nope, just two. <text:s/>Can’t get dramatic now can we?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“I thought you did drama back in the day?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“Yeah, but I always ended up playing the emotionless scientist types. <text:s/>Never very good at emoting.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“I’m afraid I’d have to disagree there. <text:s/>You’re smile could blind someone.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“Only when I’m smiling at you. <text:s/>You are my emotion muse.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“I’ll add that to my resume. <text:s/>Iefsh Lazcht: <text:s/>Very a-muse-ing.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“I’d hire you.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“Too late, I already hired you. <text:s/>Can’t both hire each other.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“You got it boss.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“Back to work. <text:s/>No slacking off!”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P41"><text:tab/>“As you wish.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"><text:tab/>The couple worked throughout the day, stopping only for short breaks here and there. <text:s/>They managed to uncover a few more leads as the day went on. <text:s/>Nothing as straightforward as what they had first discovered, but now that they were looking for the right sort of thing it was easier. <text:s/>They slept like the dead, and woke up refreshed and ready to go. <text:s/>Iefsh headed out to get some supplies they’d need to do some further experiments. <text:s/>Omth got a hold of some friends in the science journal publishing sphere, and then sent over the data. <text:s/>By noon the lovers were back at work, testing and figuring things out. <text:s/>Later that evening, a small, but well respected journal published a brief article going over the results of a recent experiment conducted by noted physicists Iefsh and Omth Lazcht. <text:s/>It was light on speculation, simply noting that these results had disproved a theory that Iefsh had proposed a number of years ago. <text:s/>The bulk of the article was simply data. <text:s/>The only thing particularly notable about the data was that the numbers were all presented to 15 decimals, while the journal’s editors usually rounded such data down to 6 places. <text:s/>A small note at the end indicated that the submitters of the article had requested this level of precision, and that any complaints or thoughts about the numbers should be directed at them, and not at the editing staff. <text:s/>A communication method was provided. <text:s/></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P42"><text:tab/>Ryl Space(Ryl)</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/>Ryl’s body shook. <text:s/>They lurched out of the couch that they had left their body while they were gone. <text:s/>They moved quickly to the purification room, expelling excess nutrients, and cleansing their body. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T38">After a couple hundred seconds, they felt relatively normal again. <text:s/>It was always like this. <text:s/>Every time they jacked into a far off body, living as a perfect machine for kiloseconds at a time, they found returning to their frail, biological body, taxing. <text:s/>It was worse when the machine body was fresh, like this last time. <text:s/>Ryl had heard that many other explorers suffered next to none of these effects. <text:s/>They had been hesitant to discuss the symptoms with others, as they did not want to be considered unfit or incapable. <text:s/>The small amount of data about this kind of thing was not very comforting, with the trend being that the effects worsened over time, and that it either ended in an early retirement, or an attempted Departure. <text:s/>Ryl wondered if they too would fall prey to this. <text:s/>It was not that they hated their life back home. <text:s/>Quite the opposite. <text:s/>Ryl had friends, hobbies, and good relations with other explorers. <text:s/>And yet still, they knew that it was getting harder to come back. <text:s/>They felt less them, less there, when at home then when they were the machine, the explorer, the traveler. <text:s/>It was part of the reason that they’d had to leave when they did. <text:s/>They’d been keeping a strict schedule, not letting themselves get too comfortable in the other body. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P45"><text:tab/>Of course this time there was more than that. <text:s/>They were going to see one of their closest friends, and in the flesh. <text:s/>Such meetings were rare, formal events, and Ryl wanted themselves to be something perhaps not completely physically repellent. <text:s/>It wouldn’t change Sil’s opinion of them regardless, which was good to keep in mind, but it was still something Ryl wanted to do. <text:s/>It had been more than ten megaseconds since they had last greeted another of their own race in the flesh. <text:s/>In many ways the interactions with the denizens of the other spaces they explored were more “real” than those that they shared with their friends most days. <text:s/>The communication methods available these days were incredible for certain, but ultimately, they were designed to be easy to use, quick and painless. <text:s/>They didn’t put fidelity of experience above comfort, above safety, above ease of use. <text:s/>But explorers did. <text:s/>While their minds were still technically present in this place, those minds were connected, almost directly into the bodies in the other places. <text:s/>It was impossible to experience or control anything back home while one was away. <text:s/>Most explorers considered themselves truly in the places they explored. <text:s/>It was a hard thing to explain to those that had never done it though, and many thought of it more like playing a game, or chatting in a really good holoroom. <text:s/>Ryl knew they were wrong, but it was something difficult to put into words, and they rarely wanted to. <text:s/>Exploring was theirs, and they had little care if others chose to participate in it or not. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T39">And yet, now, it was time to communicate some of that experience, to interact with one of those who had never explored, never left the home space. <text:s/>It wasn’t something Ryl was comfortable with, really at all, but at least, Sil was about the best person for this kind of thing. <text:s/>There was no one that Ryl was more comfortable with. <text:s/>That wasn’t to say it would be comfortable, but perhaps it would not be entirely a disaster. <text:s/>But, no use contemplating, it was time to prepare.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T40">Ryl brought up a picture of their body. <text:s/>They turned it around, assessing how best to modify it to make it more presentable. <text:s/>First they adjusted lengths and widths, making themselves taller and shorter, with different limb lengths and thicknesses. <text:s/>Should they reflect their preferences, or try and present an image that might create good impression of explorers as a whole? <text:s/>What kind of message should that be, if they did want to take that into account? <text:s/>Should they seek to appear powerful in order to inspire confidence, or nonthreatening, in order to seem safe? <text:s/>Too many decisions for Ryl. <text:s/>They enjoyed the interactions with the sentient beings in the other spaces, yet somehow, when they came back home, the whole idea of discerning motives, and figuring out people’s wants seemed incredibly beyond them. <text:s/>All the extra layers in communication set down by a hundred thousand years of culture, supposedly making communication deeper and more meaningful, instead seemed like ghosts, creating a hundred tiny little </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T40">rituals, each one liked or hated, each one with slightly different meanings to slightly different people. <text:s/>Communication on the level of survival, of simply conveying meaning was beautiful, was intense. <text:s/>This thing that communication had become at home was not that at all. <text:s/>It was a behemoth, a massive thing of unbelievable complexity. <text:s/>Again, though, such thoughts didn’t get them any more ready. <text:s/>Decisions had to be made. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T41">They decided on a compromise, taking their typical thin, frail sort of frame, but adding just a hint of muscle, of shape, making themselves look capable, but hopefully not dangerous. <text:s/>With the basic shape down, they had to decide on a color scheme. <text:s/>They usually chose a monochomatic sorta of scheme, with mild variations in tone being the only differences between skin, and cloth, and hair. <text:s/>However, the world which they had just left inspired them. <text:s/>They took a different path, thinking of the sky which had so captured their imagination when first they had arrived in that new world. <text:s/>They modeled their colors after that sky. <text:s/>And last, they needed to pick the cloth, the clothing and accessories to cover the shape of their body. <text:s/>This was always the hardest part. <text:s/>There were simply too many options. <text:s/>Style was effectively a language, and one which, despite their general excellence in that department, Ryl was not very proficient. <text:s/>They tended to prefer large, layered clothing, when engaging in any sort of social interaction, wanting to add some level of defense or protection, even on a subconscious level. <text:s/>But to do so to the extent which they typically did, it would negate all the work they had done in deciding on a body shape, covering up the body, all but completely. <text:s/>They’d again have to step outside of their typical choices. <text:s/>Why were they doing this again? <text:s/>Something about saving their profession from cowardly reactionaries? <text:s/>Yeah, that was it. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"><text:tab/>Ryl had thought they’d managed to get themselves to forget why they were doing this whole thing. <text:s/>Pressure in a social situation was not something they dealt with well. <text:s/>If they were just talking and sharing, that was one thing. <text:s/>That might even be enjoyable on some level. <text:s/>But the idea that what they said, or worse, how they said it, might have an effect on their entire profession and by extension the capacity of their race to understand the universe on a fundamental level, was entirely outside what Ryl’s mind and body were really capable of. <text:s/>They left the floating picture of their body and returned to the purification room. <text:s/>Some additional nutrients were recycled and they stayed in there for while, trying to get a hold of themself. <text:s/>There body stilled, and Ryl felt capable of movement and decision making again. <text:s/>They returned to stare at the spinning picture of their body. <text:s/>A part of them wanted to wrap the thing in a half dozen layers and screw the consequences. <text:s/>Another part however was tired of all this. <text:s/>They knew that what they were doing was important. <text:s/>They needed to get this done, and they had no reason to fear because what they needed to get done was the right thing, the only way things could work. <text:s/>If a few less layers of cloth between them and another living being would make that reality more likely, then it was what they would have to do. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T42">Ryl closed their eyes, imagined the sky in the most recent space, and the skies in the dozens of previous spaces. <text:s/>They imagined it all, and then they imagined themselves in the midst of it all. <text:s/>And they wrapped themselves in it. <text:s/>Not tightly, not to cover themselves in it. <text:s/>No, instead they carried it, they wore the alien skies, bringing the skies with them, body and cloth supporting each other. <text:s/>Image formed in their mind, they sent it across the room at the little picture of their body, and the computers began interpreting, turning that thought into a physically possible, corporeal thing. <text:s/>As that work was being done, Ryl once again dealt with calming their body and mind. <text:s/>Both processes seemed to take similar amount of times, and they stepped confidently across the room, scanned the completed image of themselves, and after a moment nodded. <text:s/>They passed the image to the purification chamber, and for the third time in less than a kilosecond, entered the chamber. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T42">Ryl always managed to forget just how disconcerting it was to be conscious through this process. <text:s/>They watched as their skin and muscle were stripped away, then forged anew. <text:s/>It wasn’t supposed to be painful, but somehow the act of seeing it, made it so. <text:s/>The lasers moved over each part of the body, taking it apart and putting it back together in the specified form. <text:s/>Then, once the body was complete, the clothing was forged, crafted from the clouds of molecules which swirled around them, </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T42">each bit put together one by one, made to an exacting precision not fully appreciable. <text:s/>The sky was turned into clothing, and that clothing was affixed to Ryl. <text:s/>Body prepared, they exited the chamber, resetting it back to its base function so that they would not accidentally end up reforging their bodies again if they came back and didn&apos;t think about it. <text:s/>Their body was ready. <text:s/>Now for their mind.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T43">This step was more straightforward than the body bit. <text:s/>Ryl knew what they needed to make this work. <text:s/>There were elements of their personality that needed to be changed if they were going to have a hope of convincing anyone of anything. <text:s/>But of course Ryl was fond of Ryl, and so it was important to ensure that the changes one makes will make one into a person that wants to return to being the person that they were before the changes. <text:s/>Ryl had of course made mistakes in doing this in their life, and you rarely ended up returning exactly to who you were before you changed your mind, but in general it was not that hard once proper motivations were created. <text:s/>They checked the routines, made sure everything was set as normal, selected the appropriate personality adjustments, and activated. <text:s/>They felt disoriented for a moment, and then they were no longer Ryl, but rather someone very similar to Ryl, who would, after this particular situation was resolved, endeavor to become once again, Ryl. <text:s/>With this step done, all was in order. <text:s/>Not-Ryl walked towards their little used exit. <text:s/>They passed through the membrane, entered the travel pod, and entered the appropriate coordinates. <text:s/>The little pod detached from the greater pod which was Ryl’s home, and sped through the void, towards the home of Sil, friend, diplomat, and current leader of the largest group of discontented citizens in a gigasecond. <text:s/>Space folded, and the pod was there. <text:s/>It slowed, docked, and Not-Ryl walked inside Sil’s pod.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T44">A little over three kiloseconds later, the same individual left Sil’s pod, returning to the small traveling one that they had arrived in. <text:s/>It undocked and began to depart, but not in the same direction as it had come. <text:s/>Instead, it took a different path, taking not one simple jump, but rather a series of jumps, seemingly at random. <text:s/>It was elementary to follow a pod on a single jump, but as the number of jumps increased, it became more difficult, especially if the jumping points were in high traffic areas. <text:s/>It was commonly accepted among the kind of people who knew about such things that one could be reasonably safe if you took eight random jumps before heading to your real destination. <text:s/>Not-Ryl took twenty five. <text:s/>They arrived at last, at something that few would recognize as habitable, let alone inhabited. <text:s/>Yet still, the pod could dock, and they entered into this strange asteroid like place. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T44">Inside was dark, in a way that almost no pods were, not the dark of rest, or the dark of aesthetics, but rather the simple dark of having insufficient ability to light one’s abode. <text:s/>The lack of ability to completely control one’s environment was something that was all but incomprehensible to most people of Ryl’s space. <text:s/>It was part of the reason why few took to exploring, and few visited even their closest friends. <text:s/>Environment and self were linked together in many minds, one’s home being truly an extension of oneself, and who would voluntarily leave themselves behind? <text:s/>Yet still, this place was dark, its walls cold, its shape uneven. <text:s/>It was a place found, and not created, a place only slightly changed from its natural state. <text:s/>It was also a place almost undetectable by most conventional methods of detection for the people of Ryl’s space. <text:s/>It was there that Not-Ryl met together with a second, and even a third person. <text:s/>Had Ryl been themself, and not the changed person that they were, they would likely have made a very big deal out of this fact. <text:s/>Instead, they got right to the point.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T45">They want to shut down the exploration program.” <text:s/>The other two people present did not appear to have a strong response to this statement, so the almost Ryl spoke again. <text:s/>“They are going to shut down the exploration program unless we stop them.” <text:s/>This generated more of a response. <text:s/>Not perhaps the amount that they had wanted, but still, something more than the first had.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T45">Who is trying to do this?” asked the closer of the two figures who stood, badly lit, further inside the hollow asteroid. <text:s/>At the same time, the other, in a slower voice spoke as well.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T45">How could they have the power?” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T45">They are many. <text:s/>They are angry. <text:s/>They are organized. <text:s/>We are few. <text:s/>We are unaware. <text:s/>We are scattered, both across this space and across others. <text:s/>Those who might defend us in good times have </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T45">found the times changing. <text:s/>The angry people have the power, and the people who want to use that need to give them concessions. <text:s/>We are an easy such concession.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T45">How are we an easy sacrifice? <text:s/>We are literally searching for a way to exist. <text:s/>We are discovering new people and places and expanding our understanding of the place that we all live in. <text:s/>Our work is more important than the work of all who are not us!” spoke the closer one, in an angry, dismissive tone. <text:s/>The Ryl-like didn’t respond, having felt this exact same way just moments ago. <text:s/>They too knew that their work was too important to stop, that any sacrifice was worth what they did. <text:s/>And yet they had seen that that was not what all believed. <text:s/>Not even what most believed. <text:s/>Sil had shown them the people’s anger, explained their point of view. <text:s/>It was frustrating and terrible and filled them with anger, and yet, on some level, they had understood. <text:s/>The people who wanted them stopped did not have the same concerns as those that did the exploring. <text:s/>It would be easy and simple to say that they simply didn’t understand what was being done, or didn’t understand why, but Sil had managed to convince Not-Ryl that it was not quite so simple. <text:s/>While some, or even many, of the angry people were indeed in that camp, further still understood the facts, but interpreted them in a different way, their core beliefs being different, such that, with the same facts, a different course of action would seem obvious. <text:s/>These thoughts swirled in their mind as they heard the angry voice from the shadowed figure before them. <text:s/>It was the further figure that responded to the question.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T46">It is useless to ask why at this point. <text:s/>Ryl would not have come like this if they had not known that the events were set in motion. <text:s/>We lack the power to change minds. <text:s/>At least currently. <text:s/>We built this place for just such a scenario. <text:s/>We must make use of our planning. <text:s/>We must use the tools that we have in order to continue exploring. <text:s/>We must not allow them to stop us, and if that means using force, then that is what we must do.” <text:s/>The others stared at the furthest figure. <text:s/>The idea of using force against another being was anathema. <text:s/>But force was being used against them first. <text:s/>Would they not be doing more good than harm? <text:s/>Even if that was not the case, was exploring not more important to them all than good? <text:s/>They nodded. <text:s/>The closer shrouded figure began to move.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T47">I will begin making contact. <text:s/>We’ll mobilize those we know we can trust first, and then begin breaking the news to those with less connection to us, once the first group is safe. <text:s/>We are not going to be shut down without a struggle.” <text:s/>The further figure looked at Not-Ryl. <text:s/>They responded to the look.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T47">I shall return shortly to assist. <text:s/>I must gather some things from my home first.” <text:s/>Decisions made, actions began. <text:s/>Not-Ryl returned once again to their pod, and once again they began an elaborate series of spacial distortions, from the hidden asteroid base all the way back to their home pod. <text:s/>They entered into their home, and prepared to leave it forever. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P47"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"><text:tab/>In the end, Tazkia successfully got her math homework done. <text:s/>And, upon checking her rank in the morning she saw that she had indeed secured the top rank in her school. <text:s/>While both of those things were pleasant, Tazkia found herself feeling somewhat muted about them, as her mind was instead on the fantastical events of the previous day. <text:s/>She skated through her classes and her homework, able to get through them largely on mechanical action and thinking, not really any focus on her part. <text:s/>She ate a quick tasteless lunch after math, then chilled out in the computer lab, helping out some of her classmates finish the lab homework she had gotten done in class that morning. <text:s/>It was relaxing, and again, didn’t require much use of her actual focused mind. <text:s/>She was pleasantly surprised when she got a chance to help out one of her classmates who she had always had a bit of crush on, and somehow her distracted condition actually helped her interactions out. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T48">She didn’t talk too fast or say anything too stupid and if she was not too far off, she may very well have come across as smart and cool, which was certainly an improvement from her previous interactions. <text:s/>Still, despite the general pleasantness of the tutoring time, and her chance to help that special someone out, she was glad when it started getting dark. <text:s/>She was anxious to speak with Safeerah again, and she hoped she’d get a chance at the LAN party. <text:s/>It was getting close to time for the LAN, so Tazkia went home, prayed, then unplugged her computer, and packed it up to take to the LAN. <text:s/>She whipped up some ramen and ate it quickly, before heading out.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T48">Tazkia arrived early for the LAN. <text:s/>She was part of the group that ran it, so she helped with setting up the routers and getting all the cords figured out. <text:s/>She was in one of the teams for the tournament being held at the LAN though, so she wouldn’t be working during the event, just at the start and the end. <text:s/>Once she got everything set up, and confirmed their were no more issues, she got her own computer plugged in and ready to go. <text:s/>She logged in to the game, but was disappointed to see that Safeerah was not currently online. <text:s/>A few of the other members of her team had already arrived however, so after waiting for them to set up their computers near her, and getting congratulations for taking the top rank, she and her teammates jumped into a ranked game, wanting to get an extra game of practice in before the tournament started. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T48">The game went smoothly. <text:s/>Tazkia got ahead early, and unlike in her game from the previous night, her teammates managed to hold their own. <text:s/>As such, with her advantage, the game had a clear trajectory, and it didn’t require any great heroics to push the advantage and close the game out in a pretty short amount of time. <text:s/>She and her teammates high fived, and then, seeing there was still time, hopped into another game. <text:s/>This time, her opponents were more skilled, and she didn’t take the lead, but through coordination with the rest of the team, they still managed to keep it even. <text:s/>The game was pretty intense, the skill levels at all roles being very close. <text:s/>Each team was able to win fights, but never by much, no one able to get much advantage off of won battles because of how much they lost before winning. <text:s/>Tazkia and her teammates were all focused on the game completely, ignoring everyone else coming in, and setting up their own computers around them. <text:s/>Tazkia herself hadn’t had a thought aside from the game since the six minute mark. <text:s/>But then, in the middle of a particularly tense situation around a powerful neutral monster, Tazkia heard a small beeping noise and saw the following in the corner of her screen. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49">Safeerah: <text:s/>Hey. <text:s/>How’d you sleep?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"><text:tab/>Tazkia’s concentration broke for a split second. <text:s/>And the enemy capitalized. <text:s/>She made a misstep and one of the opponents was able to engage, the whole enemy team jumping on her and taking her out before her teammates could react. <text:s/>Now a man up, the proceeding battle was not the equal struggle the previous ones had been. <text:s/>Instead, the enemy team tore through the rest of her team, and <text:soft-page-break/>took a decisive lead, which they then turned into a game win a few minutes later. <text:s/>Within three minutes of receiving the message, Tazkia was staring at a Defeat screen. <text:s/>She apologized to her teammates for being out of position, but they were chill about it. <text:s/>It was a loss, but they happened. <text:s/>The important thing was to not let it affect her tournament performance. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T49">However,</text:span> when the stats screen came up after the game, she knew that would be a bit difficult. <text:s/>She played her games with the enemy team’s names turned off, in order to not let who they were get into her head at all. <text:s/>As such, she had not known, until just then, that one of the enemy players was the very person she had overtaken the previous night. <text:s/>And upon checking the rankings post game, she saw that the game had tipped the scale back in his favor, pushing her down to second. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T49">She heard a whoop from across the room, and looked up from the screen to see that very player staring across the room at her. <text:s/>He was smiling, his hand outstretched toward her. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T49">Nice try Taz, trying to sneak by me last night! <text:s/>Didn’t get away with it though.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T49">Oh, screw you Jake, you got lucky. <text:s/>If I hadn’t gotten distracted and died like an idiot we would have mopped the floor with you guys.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T49">Well, lets hope you don’t get ‘distracted’ in the finals then. <text:s/>Assuming you make it. <text:s/>I’ll be disappointed if you don’t meet me in the finals.” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T49">You worry about your own team. <text:s/>We aren’t aiming for finals, we are aiming to win. <text:s/>You guys are a stepping stone and that’s it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T49">Big words, but who just lost to who?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T49">Tazkia grimaced, not having a good response to that. <text:s/>She settled for a simple rude hand gesture, then turned her attention away from the other team, and onto her own. <text:s/>The other two members had arrived, and so she greeted them, and the team had a quick huddle, talking through what characters they all felt comfortable playing that day, and how they could work those characters together. <text:s/>It was a good discussion, and it got Tazkia’s head back in the game. <text:s/>Ready to rumble, they all sat down in their chairs and waited while the folks running the tournament figured out who they were facing first. <text:s/>Once they got the info, Tazkia turned her attention back to the screen. <text:s/>At this point she realized she had never responded to Safeerah, her greeting still sitting in a box in the corner of the screen, pulsing slowly in order to indicate that it had yet to be responded to. <text:s/>Quickly, Tazkia composed a response.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T49">Tazkia: <text:s/>Yeah, slept great. <text:s/>What is going on? <text:s/>Wait, don’t answer that yet. <text:s/>I am in a tournament. <text:s/>Can we talk in like three or four hours?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T49">Safeerah: <text:s/>OK, no problem. <text:s/>Talk to you then.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T49">Tazkia was glad the Safeerah had been OK with waiting. <text:s/>She was not sure what she would have done if she had had to choose between learning more about this crazy situation or competing together with her friends. <text:s/>Emboldened by the knowledge that answers were coming, she turned her attention to the game itself, able to focus more fully than she had for most of the day. <text:s/>And moments later, the first game started.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T49">This time Tazkia was not distracted. <text:s/>The enemy team was not nearly as good as hers, on pretty much any level, and so the only challenge of the game was trying to keep a couple of her teammates from trying to drag the game out. <text:s/>She managed to get them to focus on winning and not just screwing with the enemy, and soon they had gotten out of the first game with a win. <text:s/>A few minutes later, she saw Jake’s team had made it to the next round as well. <text:s/>It looked like they were on opposite sides of the bracket, so it seemed likely that they would indeed meet each other in the finals. <text:s/>She was looking forward to the chance to knock that smug grin off his face. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T49">The next round was a bit harder, as at least a couple of the enemy team’s players were on Tazkia’s team’s level, so it was not a complete stomp. <text:s/>Still, they were able to get advantages from the players who were not as good, and parlay that into another clean win. <text:s/>And again, she saw Jake’s team also win, just a few minutes after they had. <text:s/>That her team was winning faster was a good sign, but she </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T49">didn’t want to read into it too much, because it was pretty likely that they had just gotten easier opponents. <text:s/>Instead of worrying though, she, and her team, moved on taking the next round easily as well, again finishing just a bit quicker than Jake’s team. <text:s/>At this point it was three times in a row, so she decided to call them out a bit, catching Jake’s eye and then pointing at her watch, shaking her head. <text:s/>Jake motioned that he was just taking it easy, but Tazkia still felt good about it. <text:s/>They were getting close to the end of the tournament. <text:s/>Only one more round, then the two teams would face each other in the finals. <text:s/>Unfortunately, before they could make it that far, they had to win the next round, and it was against the only other team at the school which could really stand up to her or Jake’s teams. <text:s/>Now was not the time to be reveling in victory.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T50">The game started, and at first it seemed to be going well. <text:s/>She was winning her part of the map, and most of the rest of the map was even, except the part where the enemy team’s star player had managed to earn himself a bit of a lead. <text:s/>Her team had better teamwork though, so she felt confident taking the game late if things stayed close to even. <text:s/>But then the enemy team started moving around the map, and things started getting crazy. <text:s/>Tiny skirmishes seemed to break out every few minutes, little battles that were winnable by either side, but which the enemy team seemed to have a special skill at executing. <text:s/>The game devolved into chaos, which was the preferred style of their opponents star player, who, as an assassin player, made use of that chaos to start building up huge leads. <text:s/>And this game was no exception. <text:s/>Her team won as many of the skirmishes as they lost, but while the kills for her team were spread out among all the players, the enemy team managed to get all of its kills onto their star, making him more and more dangerous. <text:s/>He was close to reaching the point where he would be all but unstoppable. <text:s/>Her teammates were doing their best, but Tazkia knew that if this game was going to get turned around, it was up to her.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T50">Tazkia had always been a clutch player. <text:s/>She performed well under pressure, going above and beyond when pushed to it. <text:s/>She could rely on that, and try and simply outplay the opponent. <text:s/>However, that seemed to play into the opponent’s strategy. <text:s/>Instead, she wanted to break out of their pace, play the game how her team played it, not how they did. <text:s/>So, she resolved to do just that. <text:s/>She closed her eyes, said a quick prayer, then started making calls. <text:s/>She brought her team back together, focused the game around one objective at a time, and played careful. <text:s/>Assassins were best in spread out situations. <text:s/>Even ones that were powerful had a hard time when their opponents were all grouped together. <text:s/>They could kill one, but then they themselves would be killed in response. <text:s/>So Tazkia kept her team together. <text:s/>They used team work, communication, and a good understanding of the macro game. <text:s/>And, just to top it all off, in the desperate last battle, where the opponents were trying to keep them from ending the game, she got a chance to show off her skill as well, taking out the opponent’s best player in an exciting one on one duel. <text:s/>It was a great end to the game, and her whole team cheered, everyone grouping together and hugging. <text:s/>They had made the finals. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T50">Once the cheering had died down, Tazkia looked across the room, wanting to see if they had won faster than Jake’s team. <text:s/>She saw people standing up, and prepared to receive some sort of watch based retort from Jake. <text:s/>But when she focused on him, she realized she had been wrong. <text:s/>Jake hadn’t won. <text:s/>He’d lost. <text:s/>She walked over to his table.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">You alright. <text:s/>What happened?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Yeah. <text:s/>I’m OK. <text:s/>They deserved it. <text:s/>At least one of them did. <text:s/>I underestimated those guys, cause they had never stood up to us before, but they got a new player, and that player was a beast. <text:s/>Judges actually went and checked their computer for scripts because they were that good. <text:s/>Never seen anything like it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Woah. <text:s/>Tough break. <text:s/>You know who this new guy is?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Oh, you don’t know them. <text:s/>Figured that you might be friends. <text:s/>Probably a bit racist of me though. <text:s/>Its not a guy. <text:s/>Its a gal. <text:s/>Sapphire or something.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T50">Tazkia froze. <text:s/>Wait, what. <text:s/>Safeerah was here. <text:s/>At this LAN? <text:s/>That’s crazy. <text:s/>There being another Muslim girl playing at a high level was one thing, but the chances of that girl being in the same school </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T50">was insanely low. <text:s/>Was she being stalked or something? <text:s/>Was this some kinda weird prank? <text:s/>Tazkia looked around, trying to spot the girl who had done so many mysterious things the previous night. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">You know where she is at Jake?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Nah. <text:s/>She and her team went out in the hall after they won the match. <text:s/>You scared of losing your spot as the one girl in the top ranks?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Don’t be an idiot Jake. <text:s/>I think I met this girl playing ranked last night, and now she’s at my LAN. <text:s/>Its just weird is all.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Yeah, that’s pretty crazy. <text:s/>Maybe someone is in love?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">You. <text:s/>Idiot. <text:s/>Don’t be.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Well, you’ll get a chance to shake her hand one way or the other after your match. <text:s/>You want to try and beat her for me?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">I’m going to beat her for me and my team Jake. <text:s/>You have nothing to do with it. <text:s/>You’d better be cheering for me though. <text:s/>If you are off playing ranked, trying to pull ahead of me while I’m playing in the final, someone’s going to get their keyboard smashed.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Hey, no worries. <text:s/>I’d pay money to see you and this gal go at it. <text:s/>I wouldn’t miss it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">You better not. <text:s/>I gotta go get ready though.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Good luck.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T50">Don’t need it.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T50">Tazkia walked back to her computer and told a quick version of the conversation to her teammates. <text:s/>She explained that the new girl was their carry and that she was so good the judges had thought she might be scripting. <text:s/>She told them not to try and outplay her, just focus on keeping even and playing the macro game well. <text:s/>Her team nodded, though she knew one of them would now be more likely to go for the outplay than he had been before. <text:s/>Nothing for it though. <text:s/>He was good, and that was generally worth the fact that he was cocky. <text:s/>Hopefully it didn’t cost them in this game though. <text:s/>She gave him a special stern look she knew would do nothing at all, then sat back down and started prepping for the upcoming game. <text:s/>She had no idea what to expect from the game. <text:s/>Would Safeerah use all her trippy time powers to win? <text:s/>Did she just want to mess with Tazkia? <text:s/>How had she found her anyways? <text:s/>It was too much to think about during a game that was likely going to be as intense as this one. <text:s/>Tazkia just had to blank everything out and focus on the game alone. <text:s/>Maybe the girl was using magic? <text:s/>Whatever it was, she would be able to beat it. <text:s/>She asked Allah to help in case of magic, then clicked that she was ready. <text:s/>Her teammates followed up quickly, and a minute later they were in the game. <text:s/>It was time to put this crazy time travel thing to the test. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T51">Tazkia picked a character she seldom selected when playing the game at tournaments. <text:s/>It was the character she had made a name for herself on, back before she had been on any kind of team. <text:s/>It was a flashy character, with a lot of potential to do amazing things, but a lot of potential to screw yourself over as well. <text:s/>It was something of a selfish selection, as it would force her teammates to play around her instead of it being a more even distribution of power on the team. <text:s/>She felt kind hypocritical picking it after she had just told all her teammates not to try and outplay, not to get fancy, but just win by playing the strategy game better. <text:s/>And indeed her teammate who she had known would want to try and go for the outplay raised an eyebrow at her when she selected the character. <text:s/>She shrugged back at him. <text:s/>She wasn’t quite sure why she had done it herself. <text:s/>It had felt like the right thing to do. <text:s/>Plus, you know, it was exciting. <text:s/>A chance to challenge the girl who had magic powers or something. <text:s/>It was a testament to the rest of the teams trust in her that they picked characters to support her, not complaining about it, and just going for the best composition based on what she had selected. <text:s/>Tazkia knew she was lucky to have these kinds of friends, especially in the finals. <text:s/>It would be up to her, win or lose. <text:s/>It had to be scary to give that kind of control up to her, but they did so, and she was ready to repay the faith. <text:s/>It was time to win.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T52">The game got off to a violent start. <text:s/>Everyone was amped up from being in the finals, and aggressive plays were made on both sides. <text:s/>Both teams invaded deep into enemy territory to go for </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T52">kills, and were collapsed upon, resulting in losses for both sides. <text:s/>The only ones able to escape the initial skirmishes without a death or two were her and Safeerah. <text:s/>For a bit after the first couple scuffles it seemed like it had calmed down, but soon the action resumed, and just didn’t let up. <text:s/>It was battle after battle after battle. <text:s/>Fights every minute. <text:s/>The kill count for both sides after twenty minutes eclipsed the total kill count for all of their previous games that day. <text:s/>And as the bloodbath continued, it was Tazkia and Safeerah that stood above it all, killing, but never getting killed. <text:s/>The game moved ever onward and it was getting close to the point where one decisive battle for either side, could mean the end of the game. <text:s/>And yet, while this would usually inspire hesitation, or at least caution, in this game, the pace kept up. <text:s/>Battles were won and lost, but each was by the skin of the teeth, no decisive victories at all, just a series of barely won kerfuffles. <text:s/>The tension ratcheted ever up. <text:s/>Most of the LAN wasn’t playing their own games, but instead watching the climactic finale. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T53">Tazkia was in a flow state. <text:s/>She was acting and reacting without thinking, the pull of the game guiding her actions. <text:s/>It was an intense feeling of both concentration and peace. <text:s/>And in that state, where her whole self was in the game, she found herself able to think about how to proceed. <text:s/>She knew her character, and everyone else’s, and she could see how they could begin to turn the game. <text:s/>A plan solidified, and she began making quick, small calls to the rest of her teammates. <text:s/>They caught on to what she was thinking and began working towards the goal, even without her pushes. <text:s/>The game’s rhythm changed slowly to reflect Tazkia’s, and all the of the characters in the game were pulled, slowly, as if by gravity towards the one decisive location, the one place and point in time that Tazkia knew could win them the game. <text:s/>Everything came together, and the ebb and flow of the game reached the critical point. <text:s/>In the perfect moment, Tazkia’s team struck.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T53">It was flawless. <text:s/>The team’s were equal in power, each character a match for another on the opposite side, and yet, due to the terrain and ordering of the units, Tazkia’s team was able to focus their damage on one target at a time, while Safeerah’s team could not all get their damage out at once, and what damage they could apply was split across many targets. <text:s/>Once the first target fell, it made the second easier. <text:s/>Safeerah’s team collapsed, like dominoes, and the game was over. <text:s/>Or at least, it should have been. <text:s/>Because, in the last moment, when all of her allies had fallen, Safeerah did the impossible. <text:s/>It was five versus one, a situation that was all but mathematically impossible for her to get out of, and yet, in that moment Tazkia saw what her opponents must have seen that previous night. <text:s/>It was beyond human reaction speed. <text:s/>Every pixel of movement was precise, and all towards the purpose of victory. <text:s/>In disbelief Tazkia saw it change from one versus five, to one versus four, then three, two, and then at last it was just her and Safeerah. <text:s/>She had been barely able to follow Safeerah’s movements. <text:s/>How could she be expected to win this fight. <text:s/>And yet she had to. <text:s/>She had picked the character that would allow her to most express her skill. <text:s/>She had taken the game on her shoulders and told her teammates that the win or the loss would be on her, they just had to follow. <text:s/>It was on her, and she couldn’t let them down. <text:s/>And so she charged.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T54">Tazkia unleashed her abilities upon Safeerah, aiming them in such a way that the terrain minimized dodging space and the fields overlapped to leave no where to run. <text:s/>And yet Safeerah found that place, threaded the needle and escaped unscathed. <text:s/>All abilities down, and Safeerah’s just about to return, Tazkia ran. <text:s/>Her character turned tail and started retreating as fast as possible. <text:s/>Safeerah followed. <text:s/>Tazkia tried to play some mind games, taking a backwards sort of route, moving past Safeerah, towards the enemy base, instead of back into her own base. <text:s/>It bought her a few seconds, but then Safeerah was on her tail again. <text:s/>Safeerah’s abilities had come back up and now the chase was damaging, abilities landing now and again, slowly chipping away at Tazkia’s health. <text:s/>It seemed hopeless. <text:s/>Tazkia kept running, watching as her own abilities slowly returned as well. <text:s/>If she could land them all she could win, but thus far she had landed none at all. <text:s/>If she turned on Safeerah and missed even one, she’d die and Safeerah would take the game. <text:s/>She considered chancing it, betting it all on her skill on her favorite character. <text:s/>But then, a thought occurred to her. <text:s/>The state of the game, and a thought from her childhood came together in her mind. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T55">Her health was low, she was pushed back into the enemy base, Safeerah was right behind her. <text:s/>Her abilities were up though. <text:s/>For the time being, she was in hiding, Safeerah nearing however. <text:s/>Tazkia said a prayer, then came out from hiding. <text:s/>Then she whispered something.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T55">The enemies gate is down.” <text:s/>And with that, she used her abilities. <text:s/>Not on Safeerah, but to move past her. <text:s/>She jumped past the time sorceress and into the enemy base. <text:s/>To win the game, she did not need to defeat Safeerah. <text:s/>She just needed to destroy the enemies main building. <text:s/>And so, she raced towards it, outdistancing Safeerah, who had used up her own abilities during the chase. <text:s/>In the grand set up which had started this whole situation and allowed Tazkia’s team to take down all of Safeerah’s teammates, the computer controlled forces had been positioned in such a way that they were attacking the enemy base. <text:s/>And they had created an opening for Tazkia, who followed the line of soldiers right up to the main building. <text:s/>She struck at the great floating crystal thing, knowing that she only had moments before Safeerah arrived. <text:s/>Less than moments it would seem. <text:s/>She saw Safeerah approaching, and she moved around the great crystal, towards the other side, trying to put distance between her and the approaching death. <text:s/>It gave her a second, but the death came all the same. <text:s/>Tazkia’s screen went grey. <text:s/>But then a moment later, it turned colored again, and the words “Victory” came flying up out of the destroyed remnants of the enemies base. <text:s/>One of the allied soldiers had dealt the final blow, even after Tazkia had fallen. <text:s/>The movement around the base had bought her a second, but it had also meant that Safeerah was a second away from the soldiers inside her base. <text:s/>And in that critical second, the damage had been dealt and the crystal castle crumbled. </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T55">Tazkia felt a wave of sound, the roar of the LAN party crashing against her, even through her headphones. <text:s/>Her teammates were hugging each other and her. <text:s/>She got up. <text:s/>She cheered. <text:s/>She raised her fist in the air. <text:s/>She’d won her way. <text:s/>Not by making the big outplay, but by actually focusing on how one wins the game. <text:s/>It would have been incredible to defeat Safeerah for the win, but this was what she had, this was what she was capable of, and she had taken the opportunity presented to her. <text:s/>She, and her team had won the tournament. <text:s/>They basked in the cheers and applause for a while, then moved over towards the losing teams table for the customary handshake. <text:s/>As they got close, Tazkia finally saw Safeerah. <text:s/>She was much more conservative than Tazkia had expected. <text:s/>A hijab covered all her hair, and it even looked like she was wearing gloves of some kind. <text:s/>Still, the hijab and dress were colorful, reds and greens and golds all mixed together in an interlocking pattern of great complexity. Tazkia absentmindedly shook hands with the other members of the team before at last reaching the girl who had caused so much upheaval in her life in the last twenty four hours. <text:s/>What would she say? <text:s/>Would she talk to her about the time stuff right here and now, or would they have to meet up later? <text:s/>Did she really want to learn about all this crazy magic stuff? <text:s/>Had she dreamed it all? <text:s/>I mean the girl was insanely good at the game. <text:s/>Maybe she had just carried them last night and Tazkia had made up the slow time bit in her head. <text:s/>And the extra hours of sleep thing. <text:s/>She had been tired. <text:s/>Still, it was time for answers. <text:s/>The girl finally looked up, grasping Tazkia’s hand, and looking her in the eyes. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T56">The eyes were impossible. <text:s/>They were like nothing Tazkia had seen or even imagined. <text:s/>It was only faintly that she heard the girl speak, so transfixed was she by the profound impossibility of Safeerah’s eyes. <text:s/>It was like a universe and a kaleidoscope and a fractal and one of those weird pictures created by AIs looking for certain images in pictures. <text:s/>It was infinite and expanding. <text:s/>It was fire and smoke and water and a flock of bats. <text:s/>It was trippy as all get out. <text:s/>And Tazkia could not look away. <text:s/>She had not heard what the girl said. <text:s/>She was barely able to think at all. <text:s/>Still, by an effort of will, she spoke in a soft voice, filled with awe.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T56">Sorry, I missed that. <text:s/>Can you say again?” <text:s/>The eyes seemed to swirl in response to this. <text:s/>They pulled at her, drawing Tazkia’s mind, Tazkia’s thoughts towards them. <text:s/>She could see less and less of the world. <text:s/>There was only the feeling of Safeerah’s hand and her endless, eternal, eyes. And then, again, still almost imperceptible against the sheer sensual overload of the eyes, her voice, soft and soothing. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T56">Want to see something cool?” <text:s/>Tazkia nodded mutely. <text:s/>And then time stopped. <text:s/>Literally. </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:soft-page-break/>7</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/>Wild Space(Yazmit)</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T57">It was an odd place, even for Yazmit, who had been to so many different places. <text:s/>It wasn’t an empty white space, or black space, or even any color at all, at least that Yazmit could perceive. <text:s/>It was a bit difficult to say at the moment however, the rules of this world not being particularly conducive to seeing. <text:s/>Nor were the conducive to hearing, or smelling, or tasting. <text:s/>It was only touching that worked in this world, and a strange version of it at that. <text:s/>It was decidedly uncomfortable here, and had he had the option, Yazmit would have simply went on to the next space, content to leave this annoying place behind him. <text:s/>However, the nature of movement in this place was such that Yazmit knew not how to touch his suit in order to activate its effects. <text:s/>Or rather, he knew that he couldn’t touch the suit in the right place due to this place’s peculiar geometry. <text:s/>And so, Yazmit found himself feeling his way around this place, searching for someone else in this world who he could instruct in the operation of his suit. <text:s/>He had at first been worried that in translation to this world, the controls of the suit had been lost completely, but after some initial stumbling around, he was able to feel that there were indents on his back with roughly the right shape for a control panel. <text:s/>He had of course tried to reach back to touch the controls, but his head was in the way, and when one was in a two dimensional space, one can’t really go around things that are attached to your body unless you feel like detaching them. <text:s/>And as he had a peculiar attachment to his head, and the brain which was presumable contained within it, he elected to go exploring and search for another living being that could aid him in activating the suit and getting him out of this strange and disorienting place. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T57">There was a certain level of fear in Yazmit that he would not be able to percieve life even if he should encounter it. <text:s/>How would he be able to tell a living rectangle person from a rectangle that was simply floating about or sitting still? <text:s/>He supposed that they would be able to move, and would attempt communication. <text:s/>Of course that part would be tricky as well without access to his suits automated translation software. <text:s/>This was looking like a place that he’d be spending a good bit of time. <text:s/>Seeing as he had nothing better to do while wandering around aimlessly, Yazmit decided to try and classify some of the differences in sensation he was experiencing and translate them in his head into equivalents from his usual universe experiences. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T58">The first thing to be translated was color. <text:s/>Different objects had different feelings from each other on a couple different levels. <text:s/>There was something like a texture, based on the outline of the objects. <text:s/>This was different however from another feeling, one that he believed had something to do with the density of the inside of the shapes. <text:s/>It was these different inside feelings that he translated into colors in his head. <text:s/>The emptiness he largely moved through was white in his mind, having only a faint amount of the peculiar sensation. <text:s/>Different objects had different feelings, which he translated into different colors. <text:s/>The spiky triangles were green in his mind. <text:s/>The large many angled shapes were red. <text:s/>The spindly star shaped things were purple. <text:s/>It was a fun exercise. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T58">Once he had managed to get his mind doing this translation without direct effort he decided to focus on the texture of the outside. <text:s/>The lazy way to do that would be just to translate texture to texture, but he wanted to turn it into something visual, so he could perceive these shapes in some way as visible objects. <text:s/>He considered brightness first, maybe changing his color perception to be lighter or darker depending on the texture, but decided it was less of a direct scale than that. <text:s/>There were really three points that could be moved towards and not simply two like light and dark. <text:s/>Objects could be rough, they could be curvy, they could be straight, or they could be somewhere in between any of these three places. <text:s/>With those limiters, he tried to think of what visual things might have three extremes. <text:s/>Perhaps reflective, dull, and sharp? <text:s/>Those would kinda work. <text:s/>So, as he traveled along he began to try and perceive each shape as being some color, and that color being somewhere on the chrome/matte/solid sorta continuum. <text:s/>It took his mind off the dull reality of his wandering, and would, he hoped, be helpful when he at last encountered another living thing. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T59">And so the travel continued, but now instead of encountering triangles with rough edges and a medium amount of central force, he was seeing matte red triangles. <text:s/>Instead of curvy, heavy squares, they were a shiny blue coloring. <text:s/>And with that new perceptual metaphor, it became much easier for Yazmit to start building himself something of a mental map. <text:s/>With colors as a guide he started to see some patterns, to notice some discrepancies. <text:s/>It may have been biases from what he associated the different types of colors to represent in other worlds, but he definitely had the feeling that they shiny colors were constructed in some sense, and that there was a distinct direction where the amount of shiny shapes increased. <text:s/>And so, despite his concern that he might just be making up a connection where none existed, he decided to head in that direction, to seek out the places of highest shiny density. <text:s/>And as he did so, it soon became apparent that the areas with higher shiny density had higher density in general. <text:s/>The number of shapes he encountered increased, and they were closer together, though in general a bit smaller. <text:s/>Yazmit was in general a pretty positive guy, so he took this as a sign that he was going in the right direction and continued on his path. <text:s/>As luck would have it, he was right.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T60">His first perception of the living creatures around him was a feeling unlike any he had thus far experienced in this world. <text:s/>It was a pulsing which, after this particular encounter had resolved, he would later reclassify in his head as a sound, as it was created by the movement of others, and lasted a finite amount of time. <text:s/>Upon first feeling it though, he was unsure what it was at all, and simply stood still. <text:s/>The feeling got stronger and stronger, until suddenly, he felt a great pain. <text:s/>Something had pierced his side, and seemed to be attempting to keep piercing through his whole body. <text:s/>He instinctively struck back at the thing which had pierced him. <text:s/>It was a dull yellow triangle, and it drew back, away from him upon his strike. <text:s/>He felt the sensation he would come to associate with sound again however, this time from the other side. <text:s/>Yazmit was nothing if not a quick learner, and this time he hurled himself aside, perceiving the creature barely skate past him. <text:s/>He brushed against it as it passed, and saw that it was similar to the other, just a bit of a different shade of yellow. <text:s/>Were these beasts, or were they sapient creatures? <text:s/>Were they simply hostile, or had he done something that broke some kind of taboo? <text:s/>He really wanted access to his suit’s systems right about now. <text:s/>He felt the movement sensations again, and knew that they were gearing up to strike again. <text:s/>Now was not the time for contemplation. <text:s/>It was time to beat these things and not die. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T60">Yazmit had always prided himself as a fighter, but he had no idea why that would be really. <text:s/>He’d been in a very few fights, and none that were not massively stacked in his favor. <text:s/>Still, he’d always assumed that when the chips were down, he could get the job done, that he’d be a bit smarter, a bit faster than someone else in the same situation. <text:s/>And as much as many who knew him hoped this would come back to bite him, as it turned out, his groundless optimism and assumptions of his own innate superiority turned out to be true. <text:s/>He figured out the sensations of movement, started using them to map the locations of the creatures he was fighting, and when they charged together, he struck, moving to dodge, then spinning to grab one of the triangles. <text:s/>Or rather he had meant to grab one of the triangles, but had forgot that grabbing doesn’t really work in the same way in two dimensions. <text:s/>Instead he was forced to simply push the creature violently, trying to aim it in the general direction of the other triangle. <text:s/>Somehow it worked, and the one creature stabbed into the other. <text:s/>It was a gentle stab, but as soon as it had been done, the two triangles forgot about Yazmit entirely, suddenly focusing entirely on each other, whirling and stabbing. <text:s/>Yazmit listened to the fight, trying to figure out what was going on. <text:s/>When the sounds stopped, he moved towards where he had last felt the two. <text:s/>He felt the skitter of one of the triangles moving away as he got close. <text:s/>And then, he felt the other triangle, unmoving, great gashes and stabs in its sides. <text:s/>It seemed that it had been killed. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T60">Yazmit thought about what to do. <text:s/>Could he eat this thing somehow? <text:s/>Or maybe use the sharp bit on its end to try and press buttons he couldn’t get to on his suit? <text:s/>Before he could decided, he was interrupted by a soft noise. <text:s/>Someone was approaching, but doing so slowly. <text:s/>He turned towards the source of the noise, which slowed down but didn’t stop when he did so. <text:s/>He felt it getting closer and closer, and then it reached out and touched him. <text:s/>Ah, this was the communication then. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T61">Yazmit would have then begun the arduous process of establishing a method of communication with the foreign sapient being. <text:s/>Indeed he started counting the different movements of the limb touching him, looking for patterns in the ways that the individual was changing its limb color and shading. <text:s/>But before he had a chance to really get into that very much, he felt the touch of the other individual move to make contact with the wound he had suffered battling the triangles. <text:s/>And in that instant Yazmit felt a very bizarre sensation and suddenly there was a thought in his head.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T61">&lt;Who are you? <text:s/>Or rather, what are you?&gt; <text:s/>Wait, did these creatures have telepathy? <text:s/>Could they read thoughts directly or only those directed at them intentionally?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T61">&lt;All of them. <text:s/>Just think about who you are and I will know.&gt; <text:s/>Yazmit thought as carefully as he could about himself, the grand explorer. <text:s/>He was very careful not to think about <text:s/>concern regarding this mind reading thing, and his plans to perhaps get out of there as soon as he could.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T62">&lt;You can’t move your body unless I let you. <text:s/>I’m in your head, and I have the control. <text:s/>You have your thoughts and memories and that&apos;s it. <text:s/>The rest is up to me.&gt; <text:s/>Well, that was concerning indeed. <text:s/>Maybe they were susceptible to some of the anti mind reading techniques that he had heard about in stories in the past? <text:s/>Lets see how they respond to this. <text:s/>And with that, Yazmit began thinking random numbers, an endless stream of integers, rationals, transcendentals, and even complex numbers. <text:s/>He even threw in a few quaternions for good measure.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T62">&lt;Interesting. <text:s/>That is indeed rather uncomfortable. <text:s/>I would appreciate it if you stopped. <text:s/>I can just lock you out of your own body and leave you be. <text:s/>And I will do so if you continue in this vein.&gt; <text:s/>Shoot. <text:s/>Maybe they were bluffing. <text:s/>He didn’t exactly have a lot of information here. <text:s/>Could he trick them somehow into letting him go, or activating his suit?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T62">&lt;Your suit? <text:s/>What is a suit and what does it do?&gt; <text:s/>Quick images of transferring between worlds appeared in Yazmits mind. <text:s/>It was pretty tricky to not think about something. <text:s/>He’d have to practice. <text:s/>Can I not think about the color red? <text:s/>Nope, its not working. <text:s/>Maybe he could not think about something he didn’t know about? <text:s/>But what to choose? <text:s/>Wait, how come the mind intruder wasn’t talking? <text:s/>Did they leave? <text:s/>Could he move his body?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T62">&lt;No, not yet. <text:s/>W-what are you? <text:s/>What is this insane way that you think? <text:s/>What are these colors and images in your head? <text:s/>What in the hell is that place where you imagined going using your suit? <text:s/>It was beyond imagining. <text:s/>It was insanity.&gt; <text:s/>Oh yeah, images of a three dimensional space had to be trippy for a species that neither saw nor existed in the third dimension. <text:s/>What if he pictured four dimensional space? <text:s/>Would that weird them out even more? <text:s/>He did so.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T62">&lt;What. <text:s/>I don’t even… Are you a god? <text:s/>Or a madman? <text:s/>These thoughts are not natural.&gt; <text:s/>As best he could, Yazmit focused his mind on a specific response.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T62">&lt;I am not from around here. <text:s/>I am a traveler from another space, another reality. <text:s/>I walk between realities. <text:s/>Most of the realities I travel through have a third dimension, occasionally even more.&gt; <text:s/>Yazmit waited. <text:s/>There was mental silence, filled only with Yazmit thinking about the fact that he was not really thinking about anything, but now he was, it was really hard to not think about stuff wasn’t it. <text:s/>Maybe he could not think about stuff now. <text:s/>Nope. <text:s/>How about now. <text:s/>Ooh, maybe he did it there? <text:s/>Its kinda hard to tell. <text:s/>Or like keep track of how long exactly one thinks of nothing. <text:s/>Could you even keep track of that without some external source? <text:s/>Probably not.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T63">&lt;Shut up. <text:s/>Your mental conversations are absurd and tiresome. <text:s/>You are an incredible being from beyond space, and yet your thoughts are like that of a child. <text:s/>Is there no mental communication in your spaces?&gt; <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T63">&lt;Nope, this is new to me. <text:s/>Everyone keeps there thoughts for themselves in my spaces.&gt;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T63">&lt;How then do you communicate?&gt; <text:s/>Yazmit thought about words and radios and speech.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T63">&lt;That&apos;s so… inefficient. <text:s/>You’d constantly be misinterpreting each other? <text:s/>How can anyone ensure that the other is communicating truth?&gt;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/>&lt;You can’t really. <text:s/>Its pretty crazy. <text:s/>People misunderstand each other all the time. <text:s/>And lie to one another. <text:s/>And lie to themselves. <text:s/>It is a pretty bizarre situation I guess, now that I think about it. <text:s/><text:soft-page-break/>Less invasive than this whole mind control thing though. <text:s/>You can talk without either person having control of the other person’s mind.&gt;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/>&lt;What? <text:s/>How do you make decisions then, if no one can have the last word?&gt;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/>&lt;You can agree, or disagree, or decide to work together, or not. <text:s/>You can even do things that you don’t really want to do just cause you want to make the other person happy, or you think they have the right idea or something. <text:s/>Its pretty haphazard.&gt;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/>&lt;This is… troubling. <text:s/>I don’t know what to feel about this. <text:s/>I am intrigued, and yet… everything is so chaotic.&gt; <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/>&lt;Would you like to see it?&gt;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/>&lt; <text:s text:c="184"/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:s text:c="155"/>Yes.&gt;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/>&lt;Whoa! <text:s/>You thought about nothing for a really long time. <text:s/>You even thought nothing at me, and I heard the nothing! <text:s/>That’s really cool.<text:span text:style-name="T64">&gt;</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T64">&lt;You are a madman. <text:s/>You marvel at the tricks of a child, and yet think thoughts beyond understanding with ease. <text:s/>How can we experience this place?&gt; <text:s/>Yazmit thought the correct way to press buttons on his suit in order to transfer them out of here. <text:s/>He considered giving his mind person the wrong instructions but decided against it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T64">&lt;Good choice madman. <text:s/>I could have seen through that with ease.&gt; <text:s/>The creature which had invaded Yazmit’s mind moved around to the other side of him and pressed the appropriate buttons. <text:s/>There was no sensation. <text:s/>There was just black, endless black. <text:s/>And Yazmit could move again. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T64">He peered down at his limbs, never having been more thankful for their ability to pass over his head and each other. <text:s/>He checked the status of his suit. <text:s/>It was indeed just a standard black space. <text:s/>Nothing remarkable. <text:s/>But what had happened to his brain intruder? <text:s/>Had they been unable to handle the transition to a three dimensional space? <text:s/>He checked for other lifeforms, or traces of them in the immediate area and in his own mind, but found nothing. <text:s/>There was a little message glowing in his inbox though. <text:s/>He read it. <text:s/>Oh. <text:s/>That makes sense. <text:s/>What to do with the individual then? <text:s/>He could release them back into their world, or give them a three dimensional body and let them free in another space. <text:s/>He could just leave them in his stasis space. <text:s/>Either way, he needed to remember to delete his memories of the fact that his memories of how to carry a traveler with him through space were instead memories of how to trap said traveler in a pocket space so that he could decide what to do with them. <text:s/>He’d have to do it after he decided what to do with the tag along though. <text:s/>He activated a command on his suit, commanding it to remind him to de-memory himself after he had dealt with his two dimensional friend.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T64">That task prepared for, Yazmit jumped to the stasis space. <text:s/>He looked at his prisoner. <text:s/>It was very strange seeing a two dimensional creature in a three dimensional space. <text:s/>It was kinda cool looking though. <text:s/>Would it cut him if he touched the edge, or would it be so thin that it would crumple if any pressure was applied to it? <text:s/>Could it crumple, or was it locked into one plane? <text:s/>How did it perceive things here? <text:s/>There were a lot of questions, but few answers that could be answered ethically. <text:s/>He could of course up and scan this things mind and read through its thoughts, but Yazmit was not one for that kind of intrusion. <text:s/>That was what the Outsiders did. <text:s/>He was not an Outsider. <text:s/>And so he would have to talk to this being if he wanted answers. <text:s/>But, he wasn’t about to let it mind control him again, and he didn’t know how to do the reverse, and again, wouldn’t want to, even if he could. <text:s/>Perhaps it would be for the best to simply return this being to its own dimension? <text:s/>Maybe with a gift? <text:s/>Yeah, that would be good. <text:s/>He activated a few commands. <text:s/>He and the being jumped together to a particularly beautiful space that he kept for occasions such as this. <text:s/>He unfroze the rectangle. <text:s/>Then, after ten seconds he transported it back to its own space. <text:s/>He knew not what it had perceived in that ten seconds in this beautiful place, but he was sure it would leave it changed. <text:s/>Perhaps it would inspire the creature to seek other spaces on its own? <text:s/>That would of course be the hope. <text:s/>Then, it could join them against the Outsiders. <text:s/>Well, either way, it was time for Yazmit to mind screw himself. <text:s/>And he did.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P54"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"><text:tab/>Frustration was perhaps the word that best described Iefsh’s life these last weeks. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T65">It had all seemed so straightforward after their initial failure had led them to their twin discoveries about the computational nature of reality. <text:s/>They knew reality was a simulation, so all they had to do was find the bugs and then they could break out. <text:s/>But as it turned out, knowing that one was in a computer does not exactly translate to being able to hack said computer. <text:s/>Iefsh had never dismissed computer studies as an important field, but she had always assumed it was not as hard as physics, and thus that she would be able to master it if she ever focused on it very long. <text:s/>And indeed, there were parts of the computer studies that she had learned about in order to solve this problem that had indeed come very naturally to her. <text:s/>However, there were parts of it that came less naturally and parts that were just hard, regardless of one’s intellect. <text:s/>And so, after three weeks, Iefsh and her husband were no closer to having cracked the universe open than they had been when they’d realized such a thing was possible. <text:s/>They had both learned a lot about computer systems, and they’d done a lot of experiments in order to try and test some possible points of attacks, but still, no success, not even a promising area of focus. <text:s/>It was, in a word, frustrating.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T66">It was good that she had Omth for this. <text:s/>He was always there when she was feeling down, and helped her feel less anxious about having potentially missed something as she went through data, as she figured the chance of both of them missing something that turned out to be obvious was pretty low. <text:s/>She also got a kick out of learning the computer studies together with him. <text:s/>While she had been the leader of their scientific research for the last few years, effectively they had both been learning the same things at the same rate, as it was their shared experiments that were the limiting factor as far as learning speed. <text:s/>Now however, in a field where there was a ton of stuff to learn, it came down to raw speed of learning, and it gave her a lot of opportunities to tease her husband, which was one of the great joys in her life, aside from physics and breaking reality. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59"><text:tab/>It brought her back to their college days, where she had bested him in every class, even sitting in to take tests on classes she wasn’t taking, and walking away with a higher score than him. <text:s/>He always pretended not to mind, and indeed the fact that he would congratulate her instead of getting angry was one of the first things that turned her on to him, but she knew it screwed with his head a bit too, and he was always extra deferential for a while every time she showed him up. <text:s/>He was generally pretty into her getting her own way regardless, but it was always cute when he went out of his way to do all the chores, all the cooking, all the busywork, and gave her hour long back massages each night. <text:s/>In the early days of their marriage, this had bothered her a bit, as she wanted things to be fair, and didn’t want to take advantage of him being a nice guy, but as she had gotten to know him better and their marriage advanced she came to understand that it was more positive for everyone if she let him do that kinda stuff when he wanted to. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T67">So, despite the frustration of zero results, Omth and Iefsh were having a good time, working on something new. <text:s/>And yet the frustration was still there, and the longer that it lasted, the worse it got. <text:s/>Iefsh didn’t like not knowing how to approach a problem. <text:s/>Implementation, the ability to actually test the things she wanted to test had been her main limitations in physics, but now knowing even what to test for was proving difficult, and that lack of direction was one of the biggest causes of the ever expanding frustration. <text:s/>And so, as tensions mounted, it was a good thing indeed that someone finally responded to their published paper. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T68">When the pair had considered the possibility of someone reaching out to them about what they had published, and joining them in their adventures to hack reality, they had envisioned some kind of computer genius kid. <text:s/>Maybe a genius undergrad too smart for their classes, or a rebellious hacker type, outside the system, and wanting to break out of more. <text:s/>What they failed to realize, is that those types of people rarely read the kind of science journal that they had published in, and were not likely to </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T68">randomly decide to put huge amounts of effort into scouring data from what seemed like a pretty uninteresting article. <text:s/>No, it was not the rebellious youth that came to their aid. <text:s/>Instead it was the persnickety elderly that came to join their ranks. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T68">Zvikst Tyobr was a respected physicist and mathematician who many considered over the hill. <text:s/>He was well known for his obsession with ordered thoughts, ordered lives, and ordered mathematics. <text:s/>His love of mathematical order had extended out into the everyday lives of those around him, and he was perhaps best known these days for his doomed crusade to restore the concept of uniforms, deprecated more than a century prior, to the college campus where he worked. <text:s/>This was after he had already attempted to get the town to change road names into numbers, tried to eliminate electives from the college syllabus in favor of one designated path of classes, and make facial hair mandatory for those able to grow them in order to make that characteristic more measurable. <text:s/>Who else but Zvikst would have been so annoyed by an article printing more decimal places than the style guide suggested, that he printed the whole thing out, and started combing through them, wanting to prove that there was zero data in those extra digits and that the folks who had asked them to be printed should be charged for the extra ink on every journal, and the extra time that every scientist would spend skimming the article. <text:s/>Who else would have been so precise in looking for a lack of informational content that he discovered the same imperfections that Iefsh and Omth had? <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T69">Returning to the preconceived notions that the pair had had concerning any possible assistance, it was fair to say that Omth was confused when he answered an angry seeming knock on their door, and found himself face to face with the notorious Professor Tyobr. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T69">To what do we owe the pleasure sir? <text:s/>I’m afraid we already told you that we aren’t going to sign your uniform petition. <text:s/>Freedom of expression is important to the both of us.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T69">Bah, wearing clothing that doesn’t turn you all into a bunch of interlocking mating rituals isn’t going to prevent you from expressing yourself. <text:s/>That’s what pens are for. <text:s/>With less distractions, one can express themselves in a way that they can’t when everyone else’s thoughts are being bombarded into their eyes at every moment. <text:s/>If you are going to express yourself, I want to see your expression, not the expression of a random sampling of peers condensed into a vaguely cohesive world view. <text:s/>But… I digress. <text:s/>I’m not here about that. <text:s/>I’m here about your article.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T70">You are? <text:s/>I can assure you we had a reason for the extra decimal places.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T70">Of course you did. <text:s/>I mean, I hadn’t thought you did at first, and was preparing to right you and the paper a stern letter in that regard, but once I actually looked at the data, I saw what I can only assume you both saw. <text:s/>Its a lucky thing for you that no one but crotchety old people care enough about style guidelines in journal articles to look deeper. <text:s/>Anyone with half a brain could have figured it out if they had just looked, and then we’d have a couple hundred stupid kids running around trying to hack reality, and probably succeeding if I know the talent level of kids these days. <text:s/>Anyways, I’m here to help.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T70">Omth was at a loss for words. <text:s/>After a moment he managed to regain the use of his tongue.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T70">Well, come right in. <text:s/>We have a lot to discuss I suppose.” <text:s/>The elderly man stepped into their house. <text:s/>Iefsh called out from the lab.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T70">Who is it honey?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“Umm…<text:span text:style-name="T70"> Its Zvikst. <text:s/>Zvikst Tyobr.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T70">Oh. <text:s/>Did you tell him that we are not signing any petitions about uniforms?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T70">Yes. <text:s/>But that’s not what he’s here for. <text:s/>Hes here to help.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T70">With what?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T70">With the whole thing. <text:s/>Our project. <text:s/>Hacking reality.” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T70">Huh. <text:s/>Not who I had pictured. <text:s/>Well, honey, better show him around. <text:s/>I’ll be right with you guys.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T70">You got it.” <text:s/>And with that Omth began to show the Professor around his home. <text:s/>It was a quick tour, as their was not all that much to see when one really got down to it, and after a few minutes, Iefsh met them in the kitchen. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T71">Well, sir, I suppose we ought to start with what you know, and what we know.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T71">That does seem pretty reasonable. <text:s/>But before we do that I’d like to address something else first. <text:s/>I doubt I have discovered more than the two of you, but in the off change that I have, I don’t want to give any extra discoveries to terrorists or something. <text:s/>So, I’d like to have a discussion of intention before we talk about any specifics.” <text:s/>The married couple looked a tad offended at first, but after considering it for a few seconds, they shrugged their shoulders in unison. <text:s/>Iefsh spoke for them.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T71">Well, our primary goal is proving conclusively that our belief about the nature of reality is accurate. <text:s/>However, as we currently believe our own supposition, this is an important step, but not the one that we are most interested in. <text:s/>The goal we are most invested in is stepping up a reality, transporting ourselves out of the simulation, and into the world above, or, failing that, learning to communicate with that world. <text:s/>If we’ve reached the limit of our own simulated reality, then exploring the world it was built in seems like the next logical step for physics. <text:s/>A tertiary goal would be to give ourselves super powers of some kind in order to give us the power to keep working on this project regardless of other people’s opinions on the matter.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T71">Couple of technocrats here. <text:s/>Not much for the will of the masses are you? <text:s/>Well, I don’t mind. <text:s/>I’ve never exactly gotten along with the masses myself. <text:s/>I tend to find them less open to the sciences than I would prefer. <text:s/>How’s the power dynamic going to work between the three of us then? <text:s/>Collaboration on the scientific exploration for sure, but what are you two going to do once we actually discover some way to create the super powers?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T72">I don’t think there is any way to enforce anything on that front Professor. <text:s/>When it comes down to it, regardless of what we agree to, whoever first hits upon the idea that actually allows the reality hacking will likely have the power to do what they want, and there is no way to enforce anything against them. <text:s/>I think if this is going to work, we are just going to have to trust that we are all working towards a common goal. <text:s/>Discussing what to do with our powers and such seems reasonable, but I think getting too legalistic about it would serve little purpose.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T72">I suppose I’ll have to deal with that. <text:s/>I tend to prefer rules to be spelled out, but I suppose, in this situation, the rules are unenforceable if one should choose to break them. <text:s/>Any of us could go reveal this to the media at any time and blow everything apart regardless. <text:s/>So, I guess, partners?” <text:s/>The gruff man holds out his hand. <text:s/>The couple give each other a look, some raised eyebrows, and they shake hands with the grey haired professor. <text:s/>This is followed by an awkward silence. <text:s/>Then Omth speaks. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T72">Well, shall we get down to the actual science bit?” <text:s/>The other two heartily agree, and they all move together into the laboratory, beginning to share notes even before they had found their seats. <text:s/>The newcomer shared his discoveries thus far, and then the couple shared what they had tried thus far. <text:s/>The old man had questions, which led to more questions, which after a while resulted in some testable inquiries. <text:s/>Indeed, in a very short time, they moved from the original discussion into acting upon and working towards some of their goals right there and then. <text:s/>Zvikst’s perspective was different enough from their own that suddenly they began exploring whole questions that they had not even considered before. <text:s/>Days passed. <text:s/>These were busy days. <text:s/>Actual hacks had thus far eluded them, but these days were busy still, being filled with testing and working towards the right questions to ask, as opposed to the aimless sort of wandering that they had previously been engaged in. <text:s/>They were revitalized by the new member, and the new member seemed to gain a certain amount of manic energy from the two young scientists as well. <text:s/>It was a match that worked extremely well, and in not too long at all, their many questions at last bore fruit. <text:s/>The first exploit of the universal code was discovered less than five days after the three began working together. <text:s/>It was not at all what they had been expecting, but it was certainly something. </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T73">One of the great talents of the professor, was his constant search for patterns. <text:s/>This is something that almost all do, to a somewhat neurotic level, but unlike the average individual, the patterns that Zvikst’s mind looked for could be incredibly complex. <text:s/>His brain sought order long after others had given things up as random, and additionally, his memory was incredible. <text:s/>His brain stuck to patterns it found, even if it could not make sense of them at the time. <text:s/>Many times in his mathematical career, he head learned some new way to look at, and organize numbers, and his brain instantly applied the new technique to a half dozen old problems that he had been ruminating on for years. <text:s/>And so it was, that after a long day of staring at numbers on screens, looking at the data that came from their experiments, the old man’s brain suddenly found a pattern that it had seen not all that long ago. <text:s/>Never one to assume, he went back and checked the records. <text:s/>And indeed, there was the same pattern again, though only a small part of it. <text:s/>It was an annoyingly small repeated bit in an otherwise unconnected bit of data. <text:s/>It was just long enough that it didn’t seem possible it was coincidence, but just short enough that it did not seem conclusive either. <text:s/>It didn’t really seem to make sense that these things would be connected. <text:s/>But still, it was something, it was there. <text:s/>So, not knowing what to do with the information yet, he decided to actually make use of this whole collaboration thing, and informed his partners about this finding. <text:s/>And it was there that Iefsh’s skills at theory construction came in handy.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T74">This may be nothing at all, but I’d like you guys to look at this.” <text:s/>He brought up the two sets of data on a screen. <text:s/>“This was an experiment you performed a few days before I joined the team. <text:s/>Take a look at the last few digits. <text:s/>Now, fast forward to this afternoon. <text:s/>Entirely different experiment, but look at the same few digits in these numbers here that had seemed to be random.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T74">Exactly the same. <text:s/>But why? <text:s/>What could these two things have to do with each other at all?” <text:s/>As Omth asked this question, he noticed his wife’s facial expression, correctly determining that she had constructed a theory. <text:s/>She inhaled, and held up a finger, and the two men turned towards her expectantly, enjoying the spectacle of her changing facial expressions as she worked something out in her head. <text:s/>The elderly Zvikst almost burst out laughing when the first thing that she spoke was.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T74">Those lazy bastards. <text:s/>They really have problems with randomness don’t they.” <text:s/>The pair watching her knew better than to interrupt, instead waiting patiently while she talked herself through the problem. <text:s/>They knew she’d get around to illuminating them pretty soon, and interrupting her now would only slow that process down. <text:s/>And so they waited, and she cursed a few more times, and then at last she looked at them as though just seeing them. <text:s/>“I have a theory.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T74">Yeah, we kinda picked that up,” said her husband.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T74">You are less than subtle about such things,” added Zvikst.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T74">True. <text:s/>OK. <text:s/>So maybe this is a stretch, but I think we just did a read and a write operation on another universe. <text:s/>I think that in the first experiment, some data was transferred to another universe, and in the second experiment, we read from that universe’s data, and just happened to read what we had previously written. <text:s/>It has to be some kind of buffer universe where there is very little going on. <text:s/>Otherwise they would constantly be getting screwed over by the interference from our universe. <text:s/>I guess maybe not, if its happening on such a low decimal place. <text:s/>But the fact that we ran into the same chunk of data we had accidentally encoded means that it can’t be changing too much there, cause if it was, that data would have long since been overwritten. <text:s/>I do believe we just discovered a way of sending interdimensional telegrams.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T74">More than that. <text:s/>Assuming we can amplify the effects a bit, we might even be able to move things about, or combine things together in the other universe, and then, by doing the same thing in reverse, do the same to our own. <text:s/>But there is a lot of logistics we need to figure out before that’s possible.” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T75">Dear god, we need to figure out where we are writing from and reading from without ever being able to see the place we are doing the writing and the reading. <text:s/>Its pure deduction. <text:s/>This is going to be so much fun.” <text:s/>This interjection was from Omth. <text:s/>The three all grinned at each other, and moments later they had already started work on the next experiment, while Omth began digging </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T75">through the old data, looking for any more cases of this happening, trying to figure out what variables might affect where data was written or read from. <text:s/>It was a daunting process, finding a string of data in a near infinite universe by poking around randomly, but based on the fact that they had done it on accident already, it was impossible that it was truly random. <text:s/>They had already done something to affect it, they just needed to figure out what.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T75">Meanwhile Iefsh and Zvikst were at work trying to encode a really long, very noticeable message to send to the other universe, one that would hopefully be so big and easy to detect that it would make searching for it simpler than if they were searching for something more random in nature. <text:s/>They wanted their message to stick out from the noise, be a very clear signal amidst it. <text:s/>In many ways this was similar to biologists using colored liquids to follow internal systems easier, or tracking collars to find animals that they had previously captured. <text:s/>They wanted to put up a big, flashing, neon, sign in the other universe, then figure out where it was, so they could then know how to find an arbitrary message in the other universe, learning, at least relatively, where messages were being saved, and where they were being read from. <text:s/>It would be, as Omth had predicted, a great big logic puzzle. <text:s/>And as it turned out, the three of them were pretty good at those. <text:s/>Two days later, almost exactly a week from when Zvikst joined the team, and just about a month from when the couple had made the discovery that brought all of this about, the team sent, and then read, the first interdimensional message. <text:s/>Across the borders between that world and the next, it was a simple message.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P57"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/>When Ryl activated their robotic eyes again, they had to work very hard not to shout for joy, jump up and down, or otherwise express jubilation in a way that might freak out the inhabitants of the technicolor thread space. <text:s/>They needed to alert the residents of this wonder<text:span text:style-name="T76">ful</text:span> space that they had returned <text:s/>however, so they did allow themselves something of a jiggle, swaying their body a bit, then waving to the one resident that they could see near them. <text:s/>This small movement was sufficient to set into action a flurry of communication<text:span text:style-name="T76">s</text:span> and <text:span text:style-name="T76">scampering about. <text:s/>In a few hundred seconds, Ryl found themself surrounded by a veritable horde of the natives. <text:s/>They were each signaling different patterns at them, each one of them trying to be the one that would communicate with the alien robot that had appeared so mysteriously not too long ago. <text:s/>Ryl was unsure how to even go about selecting which of them to speak with, as they only had so many of the threads running from their bodies, and the number of people trying to communicate with them was larger than the number of wires. <text:s/>They saw the patterns that the beings were sending, but couldn’t even find any of those patterns on the wires that they were connected to.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T76">After a few awkward moments of expressing confusion, only to be greeted by even more vigorous number signaling, Ryl figured out the communication thing a bit. <text:s/>Since there was less wires than there were potential communicators, each individual was represented by a pair of wires, and they were sending their code down both wires at once. <text:s/>However, since their were multiple individuals using each wire, their code was interspersed with others’ code. <text:s/>Ryl counted the number visible signalers, then did some quick calculations about average density of coders per wire, seeing that, on average, nine of these guys would be using any given wire. <text:s/>As such, they broke the incoming stream of messages into nine chunks, each one made up of numbers set nine apart from one another. <text:s/>Once they then looked at those broken up patterns, it was easy to find the same patterns that the whiskered people were signing at them. <text:s/>It was then a matter of picking one at random with which to communicate. <text:s/>One such selected, the real work began.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T77">Creation of a means of communication between two races who share little to no cultural background is difficult, to say the least. <text:s/>Ryl was one of the best at it in their space, and yet it was still hit or miss, and still they relied upon the advanced predictive computer programs built into the robot brain, and a long history of languages discovered, translated, or created by other explorers. <text:s/>Much work had already been done, and their were certain things one could do, in an almost scripted manner, in order to communicate certain things, create a basis that could be built upon. <text:s/>Yet, despite the predicitive computer system, the massive archive of previous efforts, and the incredible experience of Ryl themselves, it was never easy. <text:s/>It was always unique, and it was always special. <text:s/>And so, setting aside the tribulations that were going on back in Ryl’s own reality, they set to work, throwing all of themselves into the translation effort, working to understand, and to be understood.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T77">One of Ryl’s great fascinations when doing the exploration work, and the translation work that followed was finding out what was different, and what was the same between different peoples, different races, in different spaces. <text:s/>As much as the spaces provided a tapestry of endless variety, always there were certain common threads that seemed almost impossibly consistent to Ryl. <text:s/>There was always the thought, when one looked at all the different types of races and species that were out there, if perhaps the nature of the creator race was simply the average of all of them. <text:s/>It seemed inconceivable that the number of similarities that existed between them existed, and yet it was not a result of the creators’ reflexive bias. <text:s/>Almost all explorers believed that each race shared certain characteristics because those were characteristics that the creators had believed inherent in all sapient beings. <text:s/>There were of course those that disagreed, thinking it unlikely that the creators had made all of the different races by hand. <text:s/>Ryl’s response to that was simple. <text:s/>Even if they didn’t build each space by hand, they still wrote the code which made the spaces, and that code would contain their biases.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T77">For this particular race, which Ryl had started calling the Chroma, for their incredible kaleidoscopic sky, it was really the differences that were more fascinating. <text:s/>Their whole society was built upon the idea of a torrent of endless communication, and this society was built upon the nature of their space, one who’s very air created pathways for communication, complex networks of reflective light waves weaving around and over each other. <text:s/>The Chroma’s religion, and then science, revolved around these threads of light, which connected the world in a multitude of paths and ways. <text:s/>Its math had focused around knots and topology, the way things pass around each other, and the curving of the world around them. <text:s/>Despite being centuries or more behind Ryl’s own people in terms of technological development, Ryl was quick to discover that in those areas of mathematics, and even in the area of light based communication, the Chroma knew things that they did not. <text:s/>It helped of course that the unique nature of the physics in this space led to unknotted thread to be more common than knotted, creating an impression of the untangled as the natural state, something which was so obviously untrue in many other spaces. <text:s/>The Chroma had sought out the knotted parts of their space and made them untangled. <text:s/>They had learned the math of communication, of networks and relays and signal entropy. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60"><text:tab/>Interestingly, they had never developed cryptography beyond a basic level. <text:s/>Their communications were so staggering in volume, that it was many times more difficult for a third party to gain access to any given communication between two other individuals. <text:s/>And when both of them are communicating with over a hundred others simultaneously, over hundred different lines and networked threads, intercepting specific communications was almost impossible. <text:s/>As such, hiding the information sent over these speaking webs, was viewed as a waste of time unless secrecy was incredibly important. <text:s/>Ryl knew that there were other uses for cryptography which would perhaps have helped the Chroma develop other technology, but still, they had managed without it, which was fascinating to Ryl, who’s own space was all but built upon making sure every message sent was all but impossible to decode for any but the intended recipient. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T78">It took thousands upon thousands of communications before some kind of real understanding was created that allowed complex communication and the learning of all of these interesting facts. <text:s/>It was just as much or more work than usual. <text:s/>However, in terms of time, it was many, many times faster. <text:s/>The electronic method of communication was much quicker than verbal or visual methods. <text:s/>As such, a process that would traditionally have taken place over ten or twenty megaseconds, instead took only ten kiloseconds. <text:s/>Considering the time constraints that Ryl was working under, they considered this an incredible stroke of luck. <text:s/>Their previous short exchange before they had disconnected had led them to believe that it would probably be fast, but after they got going, it went by at an insane pace. <text:s/>It was actually incredible that the Chroma could think fast enough to interpret and compose messages that quickly. <text:s/>In the body that Ryl wore back home, they would not have been able to handle the message speed at all. <text:s/>It was only thanks to the robotic brain that they were able to handle that speed and volume of data. <text:s/>The more Ryl got to know these people, the more they were impressed by them. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T79">After the basics of communication had been established, it was time to get to know what kind of social or political structure these beings had. <text:s/>Sharing the kind of information that Ryl was tasked with sharing was generally best done in a way that would get it out to many people. <text:s/>In some of their early explorations they had made the mistake of starting the discourse with the wrong people and having the population as a whole dismiss their message as phony or silly because of the kind of people who were retelling it. <text:s/>And so, despite Ryl’s own anti-governmental philosophies, they had since tried to communicate their message to the most powerful individuals possible so that it would then be imbued with the authority that those individuals possessed. <text:s/>And so, Ryl began to ask about leaders and politics, looking to see if they could gain some contact with those individuals. <text:s/>The response was surprising to say the least.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T80">As it turns out, the incredible level of communication speed and volume, combined with the Chroma’s lightning fast mental speeds, meant that everyone could stay informed about most topics. <text:s/>And so, with the necessity of a representative system removed, the whole place was run using a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T80">constant, real time, direct democracy. <text:s/>Any time any controversy came up, or someone wanted some rule to come into affect, the word was put out to everyone who that might affect, plus people close to the people it might affect, then time was allowed for some discussion, and then everyone who chose to, from those groups voted on it. <text:s/>There were individuals that a lot of Chroma respected, and listened to, but there were a lot of them, and they tended to have a specific focus as far as what people would listen to them about. <text:s/>As it turned out, the Chroma which had surrounded Ryl while they were away were the ones who were experts on aliens and robots and things from other places. <text:s/>As such, to whatever extent it mattered in this distributed system, Ryl was already talking to the people with the most weight on this topic. <text:s/>Convenient that. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T80">Having established that they didn’t need to find someone more important to talk to, Ryl began to slowly move towards there own agenda. <text:s/>The first thing of course was breaking the big news to them. <text:s/>If a people were willing to accept the initial premise, that their whole world was a simulation, then most of the rest wouldn’t take too much convincing, but that first step was a big one for a lot of cultures. <text:s/>As such, Ryl approached the topic tangentially at first, circling around it, looking into religion and science surround the nature of reality, finding out what kind of computers this race used. <text:s/>This actually led to another surprise, as it became apparent that computers were in much more limited use than they were in most places. <text:s/>They were not so much more blindingly fast than the brains of the Chroma, and so a lot of their uses were unnecessary. <text:s/>Instead of personal computers for individuals, computers were largely used in controlling large vehicles or machines, and for extremely advanced calculations. <text:s/>They were much less ubiquitous and the general public had less knowledge about their operations than in many spaces. <text:s/>This worried Ryl, as they wondered if perhaps the idea of a computer being able to hold within it an entire world would seem too fantastical to these people. <text:s/>However, when they inquired about worlds inside computers, they discovered that this would not be a problem. <text:s/>One of the few uses that the Chroma had for computers was for the playing of games, and the exploring of virtual worlds. <text:s/>There were special computers dedicated to these tasks, and they could be quite convincing. <text:s/>These facts established, Ryl went in for the kill.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T81">The response was different than Ryl was expecting. <text:s/>They explained that this whole universe was a simulation, and that they came from another universe, being run on the same computer that was simulating this one. <text:s/>Instead of shock about the first part, it was the second part that led to the most questions. <text:s/>Ryl soon discovered that these conversations were being broadcast to millions of Chroma, and those Chroma were, in real time, discussing and trying to figure out where they had come from and what Ryl’s purpose was. <text:s/>As Ryl had begun moving the conversation in the direction of simulations, and even before that, some very smart Chroma had anticipated what they were going for, and the consensus had been that they were an avatar of an individual which was running them as a simulation. <text:s/>The revelation that Ryl was not a member of their creator race, but instead simply another simulation was received with some level of enthusiasm. <text:s/>The Chroma were, due to their long use of direct democracy, an egalitarian society, and interacting with someone or something that had the power to delete their entire reality if it so choose despite their intentions was something they were not comfortable with at all. <text:s/>Power in the hands of individuals or even just a few was something the Chroma did not appreciate. <text:s/>And so, when Ryl was revealed to be an equal, instead of a superior, some level of hesitance and coolness disappeared from the conversation, and the Chroma, who had already seemed incredibly friendly, began acting even more so. <text:s/>It was quite overwhelming for Ryl, and it was only due to their powerful robotic brain that they avoided having something of a meltdown. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T81">Ryl was quite touched when the volume of communication slowed down, and one of the Chroma inquired if they were doing OK. <text:s/>It seemed that some of the communities discussing the situation had hypothesized that Ryl’s world was a less connected one, and had guessed that perhaps they might have problems with the volume of communication that the Chroma were used to. <text:s/>Ryl confirmed that this was so, but explained that they would be OK if they had a moment for themselves, and then communication resumed at a slightly lower volume. <text:s/>The Chroma complied, and Ryl took a </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T81">few hundred seconds to compose themselves, processing all they had learned thus far. <text:s/>They also took a moment to recognize that this was one of the most exciting races they had ever gotten the chance to interact with. <text:s/>They were more different than usual, and yet this difference seemed to have many complimentary positives to it, and seemed to lead to an understanding that a lot of the other races who had been more similar had not been able to reach. <text:s/>This made Ryl consider their own world, and the fact that the majority of their people did not even agree with Ryl’s vision. <text:s/>Perhaps it was their race that was problematic, and Ryl was simply an outlier who was able to deal with the reality of the situation. <text:s/>Ryl wasn’t sure how they felt about that, it being both liberating, and depressing at once. <text:s/>But, they had work to do, so they cast it aside, and once again started speaking with the Chroma. </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T81">The Chroma were of course curious about Ryl’s people. <text:s/>This was natural, and Ryl did their best to speak about their world without going into some of the more negative components of it. <text:s/>It was always hard for Ryl to talk about their home space. <text:s/>In many places it felt wrong, because the living conditions and the state of the world was so much better than the people with which Ryl was speaking. <text:s/>In those cases, they felt like they were describing a heavenly place to these people, which they knew was inaccurate, but at the same time, wasn’t. <text:s/>When they tried to talk about some of the problems that their world had, it came across as complaining, because, on a surface level, the people that they were talking to had much worse problems. <text:s/>Yet, at the same time, Ryl knew these problems were real, and should be talked about, and they felt like they were misrepresenting their home if they did not bring it up. <text:s/>It was always a difficult conversation, and sometimes led to a fair bit of resentment on the part of the other species, as many times, simply due to the nature of reality differences, the things which were possible in Ryl’s home were not possible there, so some of the things that Ryl described were basically a dream. <text:s/>Here, however it was different.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T81">In this case, even though there clearly were some places where Ryl’s world had things better, Ryl felt more like they needed to defend their worlds way of doing things, almost getting a tad bit defensive about some of things which the Chroma people found ridiculous. <text:s/>Even though Ryl’s faith in their own people was at an all time low, there was something about people from outside not respecting or understanding it that rankled them. <text:s/>Ryl supposed that some level of tribalism was one of the few things that seemed to connect all of the many races with whom they had ever interacted. <text:s/>They’d always found it difficult to deal with, and yet here they were, feeling it themselves. <text:s/>Ryl laughed at themselves a bit about this, which made the conversation easier to have. <text:s/>The things the Chroma found cool versus the things they found horrifying, was interesting. <text:s/>They seemed to not care that much that Ryl’s people never spent that much time in physical proximity, as they themselves often communicated extensively over long distances. <text:s/>The idea of spending time alone, or not talking with anyone for long stretches of time however was terrifying to them. <text:s/>When Ryl revealed that they routinely spend multiple kiloseconds alone at time, the Chroma acted like they were suffering from a terrible disease, promising that they would do everything they could to make sure that that would never happen again. <text:s/>When Ryl explained that this happened by choice, the Chroma were stunned. <text:s/>There was a solid ten seconds where Ryl received no communication at all from the Chroma. <text:s/>Even when the talking resumed, it took Ryl a while to get them to warm up again. <text:s/>They had the distinct impression that many now saw them as someone with some kind of mental or social disorder. <text:s/>Still, curiosity and hospitality won over hesitance, and the conversation continued.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P61"><text:tab/>Ryl kept describing their home and the interesting things about it. <text:s/>As time passed and the questions didn’t slow, they knew that they’d have to take action if they wanted to shift the conversation to something else. <text:s/>They had an entire race brainstorming questions here, so they’d not stop for a long time. <text:s/>And so, Ryl took the lead, saying that they’d return to taking questions about their homeland a bit later, but that they wanted to focus on something else for a bit. <text:s/>The Chroma kept trying to get in one more question, but after Ryl simply stopped answering the questions they agreed to move on for the time being. <text:s/>So, with the Chroma receptive and interested, understanding the basic gist of the situation quite well, Ryl introduced the Alliance. <text:s/></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P62"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>Once time stopped, Safeerah started talking, and in order that she might listen and pay attention, Tazkia forced herself to break eye contact. <text:s/>Doing so was painful, like destroying something beautiful. <text:s/>But, she figured that the time control girl might just have something important to say, and listening to that would probably be a good idea. <text:s/>Once she broke eye contact though, Tazkia wasn’t sure where to look. <text:s/>She’d always looked people in the eyes when talking with them, and avoiding that was very awkward for her. <text:s/>She decided to focus on Safeerah’s lips for now, since talking was the objective anyways. <text:s/>They were moving, and it was high time that she started listening. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“-this will come as a shock to you. <text:s/>If you have any burning questions you can ask them now, but it might be better for me to explain the basics first.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“Yeah, that makes sense. <text:s/>I’ll listen to an explanation, which will hopefully make this whole thing seem less like a crazy B movie. <text:s/>Or maybe it will make it seem more like one. <text:s/>We’ll see.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>Safeerah explained the concept of the simulated reality, using a lot of examples from the Matrix, and explained that she was a visitor from another simulated reality. <text:s/>They had successfully found flaws in the “programming” of their world, and its connection to other worlds, and were thus able to create avatars in other realities, letting them communicate, observe, and interact with the people and places of each new reality. <text:s/>As it turned out, this particular reality had a lot of “programming” bugs, so, in addition to usual creation abilities that Safeerah was used to having access to, they had been able to exploit this world’s flaws in order to gain access to additional fantastic powers, notably, the ability to screw with perceived time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Can I learn how to do all this time stuff?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Technically yes, but the exploit requires some very specific quantum interactions, so its something that requires a certain level of hardware here in this reality. <text:s/>For me, because I am using an exploit in the connection between our realities to create some stuff already, I can create the proper configuration of atoms for the exploit to be successful much more easily.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Could I exploit the same communication flaw to make stuff in your reality, then like, make something there that would then make something here that would activate the time powers?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Yes, that would be possible. <text:s/>Convoluted, and wasteful in a broad sense, but oddly efficient in this local sense too. <text:s/>You will still need access to some technology in order to exploit the connection bug, but I believe that can be arranged, should this discussion go well.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Wait, is this a job interview? <text:s/>Are you recruiting me to be an interdimensional time cop or something?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Less of a job interview, and more of recruitment shpeal. <text:s/>But not so much with the time cop bit. <text:s/>Interdimensional part is certainly right on though.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Alright then, what sort of a group are you recruiting me for, and why me? <text:s/>Why aren’t you just telling my whole world this or something?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Different peoples have different ideas about the best way to spread the message, and recruit people to our cause. <text:s/>It is my own belief that your world is too divided right now to be ready for this revelation on a massive scale. <text:s/>However, I still think you all are capable of being powerful allies, and have a right to know, so I track down individuals I think have a capacity for doing good working, or thinking outside the box, or a hundred other things. <text:s/>To some extent its arbitrary who I choose, but generally if you are talented or interesting, then you are more likely. <text:s/>You being both talented and interesting fit the bill quite well.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Well, that’s very flattering, but I think its about time you told me what exactly you are trying to recruit me for. <text:s/>In general I’ve been hoping for a chance to go on a magical journey of destiny my whole life, but I’m going to need at least a bit of a goal, cause I don’t want to be going and like conquering other realities or something. <text:s/>Well, I mean, I kinda want to do that, but I know its wrong.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Let me respond to your straightforward question with a straightforward answer. <text:s/>I am attempting to recruit you to an organization with a singularly uninspiring title: <text:s/>The Alliance. <text:s/>The goals of the Alliance are many, as it is a pandimensional group, made up of a multitude of races from different realities, all with different notions and expectations, doing their best to try and work together without killing each other. <text:s/>A big component of the Alliance is the search for additional races and realities to turn to our cause, but that’s just expansion. <text:s/>The end goal is simple however, figure out how to break out of the simulation. <text:s/>Get access on a higher level to the computer that is running all these simulations, and use it to either communicate with our creators, or if possible, create avatars that we can use to explore the reality above us. <text:s/>And above all, secure the protection of the computer, making sure we don’t all cease to be because someone got bored and deleted a few thousand worlds for some extra space. <text:s/>So, step one, recruit, step two, break out, step three, defend our realities existence, or if this becomes impossible for some reason, figure a way to transfer the people of our realities to either another simulation that is safe, or the world which created us.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T82">Woah. <text:s/>I like it. <text:s/>That seems really solid. <text:s/>I have a million more questions, so don’t go and like restart time or whatever, but I do just kinda want to commit now. <text:s/>I’m in. <text:s/>Though the idea of being part of a group called the Alliance sickens me, I’ll just try and think Starwars, and it’ll be OK.” <text:s/>Safeerah smiles at this, and moves in to wrap Tazkia in a big hug. <text:s/>Tazkia, not being one for frequent human contact, is not quite sure how to react, but after a moment, just runs with it and hugs her back.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T83">I’m so glad you are joining us. <text:s/>I get really attached to all the people I try and recruit, and I spend so much time creating the right body and personality to do the best job for the recruitment. <text:s/>I always get nervous when it gets to this stage, because I am so invested in you guys. <text:s/>Thanks for not being super freaked out, and generally being a good sport about all of this.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T83">Time powers are a pretty good way to convince people you aren’t full of it.” <text:s/>There is a big of a pause after this, Tazkia hesitating to say something. <text:s/>“So I assume you aren’t actually Muslim then, what with coming from another reality and all? <text:s/>Or is Allah around in every reality?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T83">I’m afraid not. <text:s/>My reality had very different gods and religions. <text:s/>Mass understanding of the reality of simulation tends to deflate religion a bit though, and my reality has lived with that knowledge for generations. <text:s/>Exploring your world’s religions has been one of my great joys here.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“Umm…<text:span text:style-name="T83"> any of the hacking powers actually detect any evidence of a deities influence? <text:s/>Or are gods kinda debunked when we know that someone else created us?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T84">Afraid I don’t have any easy answers here, either way. <text:s/>No evidence for, but on the other hand, we don’t have the resources to scour the cosmos for a possible deity’s existence either. <text:s/>And, it is entirely possible that this reality is a simulation which includes a deity, or that your god may exist on the world above this one which created it. <text:s/>I can’t say.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T84">Well, that’s frustrating. <text:s/>I’m definitely going to have to think about this a bit.” <text:s/>Tazkia begins this contemplation and falls silent. <text:s/>“Well, I suppose either way, I’ll learn more if we succeed in our mission. <text:s/>Better get on this breaking out thing I suppose. <text:s/>Where do we start?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">I should warn you that my people, and others have been trying to find a way out for generations. <text:s/>Its unlikely to happen in your lifetime. <text:s/>Are you still willing to join, even if you don’t know for sure if you’ll ever see the final answers to your questions?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">Hmm, hadn’t considered that. <text:s/>I don’t really like the idea of striving for something that I’ll never get to see the results of. <text:s/>But I suppose I can deal, just by being cocky, and assuming that I’ll make the difference, and this will be the generation to crack the code.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">Your confidence is inspiring. <text:s/>I appreciate your willingness to try.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">So, what exactly am I going to be doing then? <text:s/>Will I be hopping around dimensions recruiting people like you? <text:s/>Or looking at data and trying to spot bugs? <text:s/>Or what exactly? <text:s/>I don’t exactly have a lot of experience outside of the realm of computer science and competitive video games. <text:s/>And I’m not even the best at those things. <text:s/>I mean, I might become the best, but I’m not yet.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">You will of course get to choose how to spend your own time. <text:s/>Everything in the Alliance is voluntary. <text:s/>But it is my belief that you may be particularly suitable in a data analysis or attempted hacking role. <text:s/>If those things seem interesting to you, I can put you in contact with the relevant people. <text:s/>If you’d rather travel, I can arrange that as well. <text:s/>We have other jobs as well. <text:s/>I’ve uploaded a full list to your computer system, so feel free to peruse them at your leisure and get back to me.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">Alright, that sounds good. <text:s/>I’d definitely be interested in actually directly trying to crack the reality system. <text:s/>But I’ll take a look at my options first for sure. <text:s/>How will I get a hold of you? <text:s/>Just message you in game?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">That seems like the easiest way. <text:s/>I can provide you with an email address as well so that you can message me if you only have access to a phone as well.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">OK, great. <text:s/>Umm… <text:s/>anything else?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">Not presently.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">Well then… thanks. <text:s/>For believing in me, or seeing something in me or whatever.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">Its you who should be thanked. <text:s/>We are peers now, and I look forward to seeing your work.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">Umm, before you unfreeze time, I want to ask you a question. <text:s/>Did you let me win this last game?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">Yes and no. <text:s/>I did my best within the confines of not changing the rules of the game. <text:s/>I could have won by using my time controlling powers upon the servers running the game, or slowed your reaction time down, or a number of other things, but instead I simply gave myself super sleep reflexes and then played the game as best I know how. <text:s/>I’m afraid I am, to some extent, a beginner. <text:s/>I’ve only been playing a couple weeks.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">That’s good. <text:s/>I’d kinda hate you if you let me win. <text:s/>You are pretty dang good for a beginner.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">The time powers help.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">Yeah, they do, but still.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">Thank you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T85">And you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T85">The pair stand awkwardly for a bit. <text:s/>Tazkia cautiously looks into Safeerah’s eyes again, and again, becomes lost. <text:s/>Time loses meaning, lots of galaxies within stars within atoms, and that kinda imagery, then it stops. <text:s/>Tazkia sees Safeerah turning away, and her sense return. <text:s/>She suddenly hears the roar of the crowd, and she realizes that time has started up again. <text:s/>Before she can get her bearings, Safeerah is gone. <text:s/>Tazkia is dragged away by her teammates, and much rejoicing is had. <text:s/>There is an extensive amount of pizza, a close call with a slice of bacon pizza, and a general good times and celebration. <text:s/>Jake was there, and she even got something kinda like a congratulations from him, which was new. <text:s/>Everyone kept talking about her epic backdoor, and how cool she had been. <text:s/>There was of course a lot of praise for Safeerah as well, and her computer had been triple checked after the game for signs of scripting, but when it was proven nothing was there, the respect was almost physical. <text:s/>That girl had played like no one had ever seen. <text:s/>And yet still, their very own Tazkia had still won. <text:s/>It was a game to go down in the history books for sure. <text:s/>The video had been uploaded moments after it finished, and it looked like it was going to get a lot of hits. <text:s/>More than ten thousand people had watched it already. <text:s/>The whole situation was strange for Tazkia though, because while she certainly wanted to celebrate, and she felt really good about the whole thing, there was a significant part of her that just wanted to go home and start reading about her new interdimensional career options. <text:s/>And so, when the time came for folks to say goodbye, Tazkia left, and instead of calming down, she got even more hyped.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T86">She got home, opened the door slowly and softly so as not to awaken her roommate, then plugged her computer in, and sat down. <text:s/>She was expecting to find the document on her desktop, but it wasn’t present there. <text:s/>So she started looking through her directories, searching for the file that would teach her about the rest of her life. <text:s/>After thinking about it a moment, she clicked through a couple of directories, saw it, and smiled. <text:s/>It was a text document, less than a megabyte. <text:s/>breakout.txt sitting right there in her programming folder, in the subdirectory CracksAndExploits. <text:s/>Time to transcend.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T89">Danger</text:span> Space(Yazmit)</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T87">Everything hurt. <text:s/>His head hurt. <text:s/>His eyes hurt. <text:s/>His feet hurt. <text:s/>A number of limbs that Yazmit knew for a fact he did not possess in this reality hurt. <text:s/>All the things, both existing and not, hurt. <text:s/>It was unpleasant. <text:s/>And yet, Yazmit had made this choice. <text:s/>He hadn’t had to accept the challenge of the strange space traveler he had encountered. <text:s/>He hadn’t been forced to double the difficulty of the challenge out of pure arrogance. <text:s/>But he had. <text:s/>And now he hurt. <text:s/>The most terrible, awful part of it was that he knew he could end all the pain at any time. <text:s/>He could simply leave, simply walk away from this challenge and he would lose nothing but his pride. <text:s/>Hell, he could quit, walk away, lie about it, and not even lose that. <text:s/>Well, kinda, he’d lose his own pride in himself. <text:s/>He always considered himself a person that finished the things that they started, and he wasn’t going to go about quitting now. <text:s/>And yet, it hurt so much.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T88">The challenge in question involved a far off space that seemed to have been designed to inflict torment. <text:s/>He’d heard legends of “virtual hells”, but he hadn’t expected to ever find any. <text:s/>He had perhaps been a bit naive. <text:s/>Honestly, considering his general feelings towards the Outsiders, it seemed like something that he should have expected from them. <text:s/>And yet he hadn’t, but he had been proven wrong. <text:s/>If this place hadn’t been designed to inflict pain, then fate itself was interested in that same outcome, because it was a statistical impossibility that this many creative instruments of torture would exist in this close proximity to one another. <text:s/>Why had he come here?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T88">Well, it had really been her fault hadn’t it. <text:s/>If he hadn’t met her a few days ago, he would be surfing through spaces, enjoying the views and leaving random messages to the cosmos. <text:s/>But he had met her. <text:s/>Those that travel through the cosmos like Yazmit all played a certain signal on a certain wavelength in a certain unused constant of reality. <text:s/>When traveling to a new place, one would check that signal, and if you found it currently humming, then it meant that another traveler was currently in that space. <text:s/>For some misanthropic travelers, this simply meant that they’d hop to another space, having no desire to interact with others. <text:s/>But for those like Yazmit, it meant a chance to get to know someone else like him. <text:s/>They’d be strange and alien, but they’d share the common thread of traveling and the battle against the Outsiders. <text:s/>And so, when Yazmit jumped to an inhabited space, and found that very signal, he quickly pinged back across it, inquiring about a rendezvous. <text:s/>And as luck would have it, the other traveler was interested. <text:s/>They sent him some information about the local culture and gave him a time and place. <text:s/>And so it was, that Yazmit and an incredibly appealing looking woman in a red dress, sat together in a dimly lit building, imbibing some kind of liquid that inhibited one’s ability to think clearly. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T89">So, come here often?” asked Yazmit, himself taking the form of a male, equally attractive. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T89">I’ve been visiting recently. <text:s/>Only just arrived a few weeks ago. <text:s/>What brings you to my neck of the woods?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T89">Pure chance I’m afraid, though if I had known of your existence I’m sure that that would have been enough of a reason. <text:s/>But alas, I was unaware of that till I came into this reality.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T89">You wander randomly then? <text:s/>Zero information before the jumps?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T89">I check to make sure I won’t instantly die, but other than that, yeah. <text:s/>Its exciting. <text:s/>Well, kinda. <text:s/>You see a lot of boring places too when you travel my way, but you always have a shot at anything.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T89">That’s very dashing of you. <text:s/>Have you ever spent any time in a hell space?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T89">I’ve never really believed they exist.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T89">Oh, they do. <text:s/>I found one a few months back. <text:s/>Challenged myself to see how long I could stand inside it. <text:s/>Not that long, it turns out.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T89">And you say that I’m the dashing one. <text:s/>Let’s hear your tale then.” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T89">And so, a story was told, of exploration, of experimentation, and of a lot of unpleasant experiences. <text:s/>The two swapped stories into the night, and continued to drink the burning poison liquid. <text:s/></text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T89">They grew louder and louder as the night grew long, and their stories became less and less sensical, more and more over the top. <text:s/>And of course, as is common in such situations, they began trying to outboast one another. <text:s/>It was friendly and flirtatious, but still, it was pride. <text:s/>And in the heat of it, when Yazmit couldn’t think of anything that had been worse than the hell world, he asked for its coordinates, and vowed to be back after four days, twice the amount that the other traveler had been able to stand. <text:s/>And so, here he was, neck deep in pain, everything hurting, with three days to go, and nothing keeping him there but his own desire to do the thing he said he was going to do.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T89">The hell world was a creative sort of place. <text:s/>It had many different sorts of environments. <text:s/>There were burning places, and freezing places, biting places, and choking places, falling places, and crushing places. <text:s/>And despite how painful and terrible each of these places was, they somehow always kept you alive. <text:s/>The environment destroyed you, and yet, at the same time, it kept you safe. <text:s/>Currently, Yazmit was in a swamp place. <text:s/>Ninety percent of his body was covered in leeches and biting things. <text:s/>He could feel other creepy crawlies under his skin and inside his gut. <text:s/>The smell of the swamp made it impossible to breath, and yet the water level gave you only the chance to breath in giant gasps, inhaling as much of the noxious fumes as possible, then plunging you underwater, to choke on the air, and try and keep the worms and bugs from climbing in through your open mouth. <text:s/>Again, it was unpleasant.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T90">The pain of each gasp was no less than the one before. <text:s/>It never got easier. <text:s/>Indeed, Yazmit’s body in this realm was fallible, and so, as he continued to struggle, the struggle got harder. <text:s/>His body moved less swiftly, he was less able to control his limbs exactly. <text:s/>Despite being a thing constructed for this very environment, the brain that Yazmit inhabited had a million weaknesses, a million ways that the world could creep up on him, and make it even worse. <text:s/>The terrible feeling of being unable to breath was coupled with the need to expel foul tasting gas. <text:s/>The creeping feeling of seeing things consume you was made even more extreme when the things doing the consuming did it from the inside. <text:s/>There was no doubt in Yazmit’s mind that this was a constructed place. <text:s/>The question then, was who constructed it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T90">The easy answer was the Outsiders. <text:s/>Some messed up coder wanted to create a place of torment in order to watch it inflicted upon virtual individuals. <text:s/>They reveled in the pain, in the futile struggle. <text:s/>But something about that explanation didn’t sit right with Yazmit. <text:s/>Where were the others sharing in his suffering if that were the case? <text:s/>The place seemed to keep people alive, so how come it was not teeming with other damned souls? <text:s/>Maybe the creator had not liked the world they had created, but simply freed its people instead of deleting the world itself? <text:s/>Maybe they had simply grown bored? <text:s/>Or maybe, this was not created by an Outsider at all.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T91">Perhaps this place had started as an empty black space, or even a functional world. <text:s/>But then, someone like himself, with the power to hack into the code of the worlds, decided to make it into something different. <text:s/>They decided to create this menagerie of pain and torture for whatever reason. <text:s/>Perhaps to serve as a prison or punishment for some specific individuals, perhaps simply for it to exist. <text:s/>This explanation seemed more true to Yazmit, for it better explained the lack of other sufferers. <text:s/>If it was only found by chance, or by the choice of the individual who created it, then it would be sparsely populated indeed. <text:s/>It was of course possible that he was missing something in his thought process. <text:s/>It was a bit hard to follow logical steps, and think through all the possibilities while you are inflicted with constant pain, and your brain is constantly insisting you are about to die. But between the gasps, and the choking, in the brief moments where the only pain was the hundreds of burrowing insects inside his body, these were the thoughts that had come to Yazmit. <text:s/>Honestly not that comforting, though perhaps better than the existence of a purely sadistic Outsider. <text:s/>Yazmit considered the whole concept of what the Outsiders did sadistic, but if you ignored the initial premise of creating entire worlds full of sentient beings for sport, they tended not to make the places too horrible. <text:s/>Life could only exist in habitable worlds, and as such, the creations of the Outsiders tended to be habitable. <text:s/>He had never encountered anything close to this kind of a place until now, and that, actually was, a little comforting. <text:s/>Unlike his current state, which was, again, uncomfortable. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T91">Keeping track of time without a clock was all but impossible in this place. <text:s/>Endless torment occurred, and Yazmit was sure that it had been hours, but then painfully discovered it to have been minutes. <text:s/>He stopped checking the clock, not wanting to feel the pain of disappointment, of knowing just how long he had left here, and how slowly the time passed. <text:s/>But then, the not knowing became worse. <text:s/>Maybe he was close, maybe he wasn’t, he didn’t know. <text:s/>Had days passed, or just minutes? <text:s/>Would he simply fall into this state of accepting the pain to the point that he would forget to ever leave? And so, Yazmit, after, as it turned out, 29 minutes, of going without a clock, returned to occasionally checking it, setting timers, and generally trying to keep himself from losing all track of time. <text:s/>The woman who had introduced him to this place had talked of how she had almost fallen into a state where she wasn’t really thinking at all, in order to get away from the pain, and it was only the fact that she had set herself some extreme alarms that had broken her from that state, and enabled her to begin thinking again, as opposed to simply being a tortured husk. <text:s/>Yazmit was heavily invested in not becoming a husk. <text:s/>But of course, this made it harder to deal with the pain. <text:s/>If you can zone out, if you can just kinda accept it and let it pass through you, then you can deal, but the more you do that, the closer you come to losing yourself. <text:s/>So instead, Yazmit found himself feeling each pain anew, never getting used to it, never letting it become normal. <text:s/>It was uncomfortable.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T91">After some indeterminate amount of time(14 hours and 37 minutes), Yazmit found himself in a new area of the hell dimension. <text:s/>The leeches had dried off, and he had managed to vomit up, or crush all the little beasties that had been moving around under his skin or in his body. <text:s/>This process was disgusting and painful, but it had a hint of success, or rejuvenation to it that made it different than the other pains, made it something almost positive. <text:s/>When he was worm free Yazmit began to inspect this new environment, trying to figure out how exactly this place was going to torment him. <text:s/>As of yet, it seemed oddly pleasant. <text:s/>There was no terrible smell, he was currently experiencing little pain except that that remained from the previous realm, and he was not even being assaulted by gruesome imagery as he had been in one of the earlier realms. <text:s/>This of course, was suspicious as all get out, and the tension grew as Yazmit continued to look around, waiting for the other shoe to drop and the endless torment to begin anew. <text:s/>It did, of course, but it took a longer, and stranger course than what Yazmit was expecting.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T91">It began when Yazmit spotted a small, cute, sheep looking creature. <text:s/>Now, he was of course expecting it to grow a jaw in its side, or turn into a spider or something, so he observed the creature with a great deal of caution. <text:s/>And yet, it seemed content to go about its day, eating tufts of grass, making cute and adorable noises, and generally being pleasant. <text:s/>It walked over near Yazmit, and after a long internal duel with his better judgment, Yazmit went and petted the little guy, which responded by making a noise half way between a baa and a purr. <text:s/>Its fur was extremely soft, and its face presented evidence of delight at the petting experience. <text:s/>As Yazmit played with the little guy, another one showed up, and then another. <text:s/>Soon Yazmit was the center of a herd of the little creatures, all making delighted sounds and generally being cute and wonderful. <text:s/>Filled with hesitation, but perhaps wondering if this was some kind of reverse psychology thing, meant to make him refuse any positive sensations, Yazmit played with the creatures. <text:s/>It was a good time, and all seemed to be going well for a while. <text:s/>But then of course, things began to take a dark turn. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T92">It began with the first of the sheep things that Yazmit had interacted with. <text:s/>He noticed it had stopped making quite so many happy sounds, and seemed to be in some amount of pain. <text:s/>He tried to help it, but was unable to do so, the fluffy being slowly getting sicker and sicker. <text:s/>As the illness progressed, there began to be dark spots on the creature’s skin. <text:s/>The fur fell off in those areas, and then the skin began to become gangrenous. <text:s/>Eventually they just started to bleed, and the creature eventually passed away. <text:s/>It was during this last phase that Yazmit noticed the pattern. <text:s/>The blighted spots were exactly where he had petted and touched the little guy. <text:s/>He had killed it, unknowingly. <text:s/>And as he realized this, he began hearing the sounds of discomfort coming from the rest of the flock. <text:s/>With mounting horror, he saw beast after beast fall prey to the same terrible wasting, bleeding, disease, dying </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T92">by his own tainted hands, despite all his attempts to prevent it. <text:s/>Creature after creature died, and he knew that each of them would now be alive if he was not there. <text:s/>When the last of his flock bled out, he sat down, and starred, not knowing what else to do. <text:s/>But when he heard a soft sound, and noticed another one of the creatures approaching him slowly, he knew he had to leave. <text:s/>And so, by his own volition, Yazmit left a place free of pain, a place filled with soft things and cute animals, and descended once again into a further hell. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T92">In this next place, where his skin was cut, and acid dropped into open wounds, he knew that now, it was worse. <text:s/>Because while before he had had the pain of the world around him, now there was pain coming from within his own mind. <text:s/>As much as he knew that he had not known what was going to happen, that it really wasn’t his fault on a conscious level, still, he blamed himself, and still he replayed, again and again, the dying of those innocent creatures. <text:s/>And so, while before, he could turn to his own confidence, his own reason for being there as a ward against the pain, now his mind had turned against him. <text:s/>He felt like he deserved the pain, like it was appropriate suffering for his crimes. <text:s/>And so, he began to develop a sick anticipation of the burning sensations in his punctured skin, began to look forward to the scream inducing pain of a new jagged cut along his body. <text:s/>He might very well have simply accepted this fate, and stayed within the hell world, but it was his own endlessly questioning mind that eventually freed him from this mental miasma.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T92">He of course, returned in his head to the creator of this deathless pain place. <text:s/>And he thought about their intentions, what they were trying to do. <text:s/>And as he thought about how he had fallen right into their trap, that this mental state he was in was exactly what they had planned, he began to break free of it. <text:s/>Because, despite truly feeling terrible about the deaths of the little sheep creatures, fundamentally Yazmit hated being played. <text:s/>It was the fear that the Outsiders were manipulating the actions and events of their worlds which motivated his hatred for them. <text:s/>It was his inability to deal with others telling him what to do which had led him to strike out on his own across the many spaces, instead of following along with the rest of his race in a more organized exploration of the multiverse. <text:s/>And so, now that he realized that his emotions were being influenced by the creator of the hellscape, he refused to have those emotions. <text:s/>He still felt bad for the soft, purring things, but instead of blaming himself, he blamed the creator. <text:s/>It was them which had set the scenario up, them which had made the creatures die from his touch. <text:s/>They had killed the creatures, and Yazmit was going to get them for it. <text:s/>This of course, was news to Yazmit, as he had originally come here just as a challenge. <text:s/>But now he found he had a new mission. <text:s/>He would discover the creator of this place, and he would make sure they never were able to do something like this again. <text:s/>If this had just been painful, just been something which harmed those who visited, then perhaps it would have been ok, been some kind of prison, or self testing place. <text:s/>But now that innocents had been sacrificed in order to cause emotional trauma, a line had been crossed. <text:s/>The creator of this place was going down, and Yazmit was the one taking them there. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T93">With a goal in site, for the first time in this place, the pain let up a bit. <text:s/>Or to be more accurate, the pain stayed the same, but Yazmit’s response to it was diminished. <text:s/>His mind was accepting the pain as something to secondary to his main purpose, putting aside the urgent need to solve the problem that the pain was indicating, in favor of his determination to figure out who or what had created this place and destroy them. <text:s/>The problems with this plan became evident quickly though. <text:s/>The place was a messy network of torture devices. <text:s/>It didn’t have anything recognizable as a clue, or even like architecture or things that could be used to deduce something about someone. <text:s/>What did Yazmit know about solving mysteries anyways? <text:s/>He jumped into dimensions with the cheat codes enabled and tended to brute force his way through problems. <text:s/>Was this whole sudden angry quest just a useless gesture? <text:s/>As Yazmit considered this, his resolve weakened, and with it, his resistance to the pain. <text:s/>If there was really nothing that would be gained from ignoring the warning signs which were pain, then his mind was not about to deny him this vital information. <text:s/>As his concentration wavered, the pain increased, which of course decreased his ability to concentrate. <text:s/>The situation seemed dire, and all hope seemed lost. <text:s/>But of course, as is want to happen during such times, something caught his eye, and hope seemed less lost.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P64"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>As it turned out, the buffer universe was indeed a buffer universe, devoid of any real content, and their was no immediate response to their message. <text:s/>Still, they were able to detect that they had successfully written the message, and from there, the advances were just pure engineering. <text:s/>They’d figured out the basics of affecting how subatomic particles interacted with the other dimension, and they’d gotten it to go both ways. <text:s/>With that information the three knew that they could, in some sense, do anything. <text:s/>Of course doing anything very notable at all would take an incredible amount of time and precise atom smashing. <text:s/>In theory they had cracked everything wide open, but in practice they were still quite limited. <text:s/>It was time to test their theories, and work on expanding what they could do in practice at the same time. <text:s/>With a great number of possible attack vectors for how to approach this very general problems, Omth, Iefsh, and Zvikst broke up, and each worked on different parts of the problem, different approaches and different theoretical applications. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>Omth was interested in the most blatant application, that is, directly controlling matter in his own reality. <text:s/>While they had not figured that out directly, they did technically have a way to do it indirectly. <text:s/>They could control matter on a small scale in the buffer universe. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T94">Theoretically the buffer universe should have a way to do the same thing back to them. <text:s/>Thus, if he could build something here that could build an atom smasher in the buffer universe, then he could manipulate that atom smasher in order to then manipulate matter in his own universe. <text:s/>It was roundabout in a certain sense, but it was also a pretty logical next step. <text:s/>The trick of course was the execution. <text:s/>Working with the amount of matter they could currently manipulate, at the speeds they could do so, to build something equivalent to the machine that they were using here, in the buffer universe, would take something on the scale of fifteen quintillion years. <text:s/>And then, of course, that machine would take a similar length of time to create anything of similar scale in his reality. <text:s/>It would technically be reality hacking, but in such a slow way that literally any non-hacking method would be orders of magnitude faster. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T94">With that as the problem space, Omth focused on trying to figure a way to create the same effects as their atom smasher in the buffer universe, but without the incredible complexity, and in a much more reasonable amount of time. <text:s/>It didn’t actually take him that long to come up with at least a possible direction of research. <text:s/>One of the subjects that he had learned about in the periphery of his education, outside of his classes, but still educational in context, was the idea of the cellular automata. <text:s/>These were formula that determined how one thing would change into another based on the state of itself and the things around it. <text:s/>They could be used to simulate all sorts of things, from traffic patterns, to battles of life and death, but the interesting thing about them is that they were to some extent, about as simple as you could possibly be. <text:s/>They took in the absolute minimal amount of information in order to create interesting interactions. <text:s/>And when working with them, the way you set them up, was simply with an initial configuration. <text:s/>You never tried to create complex machines to make more of them inside their world, instead, you simply set up the simulation in such a way that the interactions you were interested in happening resulted from that initial configuration. <text:s/>The interactions of particles were predictable to a certain extent as well, so perhaps instead of making a machine to smash atoms, he could simply make two atoms already on a collision course. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T94">It was not nearly as simple as that, as he soon discovered, but it looked like this line of inquiry might be somewhat promising at least. <text:s/>After a number of hours, he hit upon a configuration that he though might create some detectable results. <text:s/>He went over to the machine, which he was happy to discover was not currently in use, and punched in the configuration. <text:s/>Then, after a few moments to let it propagate, he punched in a different configuration that would allow him to detect certain events within the parallel realm. <text:s/>He activated the machine, listened to it shiver, and then looked anxiously at the readout. <text:s/>After what seemed like an almost intentional dramatic pause, the computer spat out a big list of numbers. <text:s/>Omth scanned them, looking for his result, and a moment later he was raising his fist in </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T94">triumph. <text:s/>The basic idea of his basic idea to get started with the basic idea of matter control was a success!</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T95">There was little in the way of indication of what the other two researchers in the house were doing at the same time, for neither of them had been doing any experiments. <text:s/>Zvikst had been locked away in one room, writing formulas and muttering for an endless amount of time, while Omth’s wife had been out and about, going out to look at data from a number of astronomy data centers nearby. <text:s/>He was sure that Iefsh was onto something crazy, so he redoubled his own efforts to make his goal a success. <text:s/>He decided to get the computer to help him out with some of these initial configurations. <text:s/>He programmed it to generate random starting points, then save those configurations if they ended up generating anything useful. <text:s/>It was not likely to generate anything directly usable, but it might at least put him on the right path to a good solution. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T96">With the computer doing some creative work for him, Omth decided to clear his mind a bit, and went for a walk. <text:s/>It felt weird walking around town. <text:s/>He had been losing track of time in the house, and the few times he had gone out, had all been for food or very specific purposes. <text:s/>He hadn’t actually looked at the world around him for days. <text:s/>The sun was shining, people were doing there thing, society was continuing. <text:s/>It felt strange to him that nothing appeared to have changed. <text:s/>He of course knew that he hadn’t told anyone about the fantastic new world they lived in now, but it still felt as though perhaps the very feeling of the world might be changed just because he knew. <text:s/>But it didn’t. <text:s/>Things carried on, and Omth found some level of happiness in that, even as he also looked forward to cracking through the veil of ignorance which currently surrounded the world. <text:s/>He wondered how the average person would react to the knowledge they were being run on someone’s computer. <text:s/>Perhaps they wouldn’t care. <text:s/>Perhaps they’d lose satisfaction in life. <text:s/>Perhaps they’d join him in overthrowing the programmers of their virtual world. <text:s/>It was a complete mystery, and he loved that.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T96">It was a few minutes later when he was passing over a footbridge in a public garden that he was accosted. <text:s/>Two tall individuals in long black coats and black, big brimmed hats, grabbed each arm. <text:s/>One a man, and one a woman, they forcibly moved him between them and stood so that all three overlooked the small bit of running water beneath them. <text:s/>Omth was completely unprepared for this, and had no idea what was going on. <text:s/>Was he being mugged? <text:s/>He didn’t have much on him. <text:s/>Hopefully they’d be satisfied and wouldn’t beat him up. <text:s/>As his mind raced through a hundred terrible scenarios, he tensed up. <text:s/>His mental theatre of terror was interrupted however by the voice of the dark coated female. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T97">Why don’t we talk a bit about your work Mr. Lazcht. <text:s/>We are particularly interested in your most recent work. <text:s/>We’d love to hear all about it.” <text:s/>It took Omth a few seconds to parse the words that were being spoken to him, the fright clogging up his mental faculties. <text:s/>They were after his work? <text:s/>Or more likely his wife’s work. <text:s/>But wait, they said recent. <text:s/>Did they mean the interdimensional stuff? <text:s/>How could anyone know about that yet? <text:s/>I mean, maybe they figured out the data in the journal, like Zvikst, but then, why go through all this trouble, and not just ask about it like normal people? <text:s/>Maybe they were just bad at communication and didn’t mean to be this threatening? <text:s/>He looked at the woman, hoping he had perhaps misunderstood her intentions. <text:s/>But when he saw the blank look of a killer, and noticed the butt of a weapon of some kind sticking out of a lower down pocket, he realized he had not been making a mistake in characterizing these guys. <text:s/>He had been snagged by thugs who wanted to know about his most recent research. <text:s/>Giving thugs access to the secrets of the universe did not seem like a great plan though. <text:s/>On the other hand, neither did getting beat to death in a public park. <text:s/>Perhaps playing dumb was the way to go.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T97">Ma’am, I am not quite sure what you are asking about? <text:s/>My wife and I just published our most recent research a short time ago. <text:s/>I can tell you which issue if you happened to have missed it. <text:s/>That contained the bulk of our discoveries for the last good while.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T97">Don’t take me for a fool Mr. Lazcht. <text:s/>I tend to get a bit angry when I am treated like a fool.” <text:s/>As she said this last bit, she had reached into one of the many pockets of her thick black coat and pulled </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T97">out a thin, sharp looking, blade. <text:s/>She flicked it open, and laid it gently against Omth’s face. <text:s/>Then she dragged it back in a quick motion, and Omth felt a warm fluid flowing down the side of his face. <text:s/>He could almost not feel the wound itself. <text:s/>“I would recommend you start treating me with a bit more dignity Mr. Lazcht.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T97">Omth grimaced. <text:s/>Being threatened with a knife tended to do little for one’s long term planning skills. <text:s/>He was tempted just to tell this person everything. <text:s/>It wasn’t like it was technically a secret right? <text:s/>Something in him recoiled at the idea of having science revealed through threats of violence though, and some small bit of resistance collected itself inside him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T98">Ma’am, I’m sorry if I came off as dismissive. <text:s/>I’ll endeavor to be more open to discussion. <text:s/>I am afraid I still don’t have much to tell you though. <text:s/>My wife and I published our work. <text:s/>We were a bit disappointed in it, and have been retesting our hypothesis again this last while in hopes we screwed up, and our theories are ultimately to be verified.” <text:s/>The woman looked at him, then shook her head slowly. <text:s/>He felt the grip of her partner tightening on his arm. <text:s/>The blade was dancing in front of his face again.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68"><text:tab/>“You didn’t want to do that Mr. <text:s/>We should be working together. <text:s/>Your making a pretty big mistake here.” <text:s/>Suddenly the knife was touching Omth’s skin. <text:s/>He felt it dig in slowly, and this time he felt the cut, as she crept it along his cheek, cutting deep ever so slowly. <text:s/>He could feel his skin being parted by the knife. <text:s/>He might have screamed if the woman had not put a finger over her mouth and started shaking her head again. <text:s/>“Oops, look what you made me do there. <text:s/>That’s not what you want at all is it? <text:s/>Maybe you misspoke? <text:s/>Could I have misheard you?”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68"><text:tab/>Omth’s mind raced. <text:s/>What was the harm of telling this wonderful friend a little about their recent discoveries. <text:s/>Its not like it could change the world or anything right, or give people an ungodly amount of power. <text:s/>Oh wait. <text:s/>Shoot. <text:s/>That’s why he was playing the damn hero again. <text:s/>People that cut other people’s faces with knives in the middle of parks shouldn’t have access to reality altering information. <text:s/>That seemed a solid rule to live by. <text:s/>Just had to keep it in mind for this whole conversation and perhaps he might be able to keep his cool. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68"><text:tab/>“What are you doing? <text:s/>You realize you just cut my face with a knife like twice right? <text:s/>I can’t exactly blame these cuts on shaving. <text:s/>I have no idea who you are, and I don’t know what you want. <text:s/>Or rather, I know what you want, but rather, the thing you want me to know is currently not known to me. <text:s/>I told you whats been happening. <text:s/>I don’t know what you think I’m doing, but I can assure you, there is nothing in my life that would warrant this level of cutting remark. <text:s/>Well, at least, nothing recently.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68"><text:tab/>The woman shook her head, almost managing to look sad for a moment. <text:s/>Then she raised an eyebrow at the other dark coat wearing figure, and Omth’s life was pain. <text:s/>He had occasionally been bullied as a young child, but never very extremely. <text:s/>He’d never been in a real fight, or been seriously injured. <text:s text:c="2"/>As such, he was completely unprepared for the beating which was inflicted upon him. <text:s/>He screamed and cried and begged, and had he really been in anything like a right mental state, he might very well have told these people something valuable, but in the end, he never told them anything more. <text:s/>He was lying on the ground in a heap. <text:s/>The woman towered over him, with the man standing further back. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T99">We could have been such good friends Mr. <text:s/>I’m very disappointed in you. <text:s/>Maybe I’ll give you a second chance some time. <text:s/>Let me give you something to remember me by, OK? <text:s/>I don’t want you going and forgetting our little chat. <text:s/>It meant so much to me you know.” <text:s/>With those words and a wicked grin, the woman lifted her foot, and then slowly and deliberately, she stomped down on Omth’s nose, breaking it, and crushing the skin and cartilage. <text:s/>Then she shook her head sadly again and walked off. <text:s/>Omth was still screaming five minutes later when his consciousness started being a thing again. <text:s/>He noted that his throat was getting a bit raw, and through a force of will, managed to force his mouth shut and stop the noise. <text:s/>His first though upon gaining some level of control over his body again was: Either this park is a lot emptier than I thought it was, or there are a good lot of people around who are content to let a woman’s scream be without a thought. <text:s/>These parks deserved a better class of people perhaps. <text:s/>Regardless, he needed to get word to his compatriots. <text:s/>But first he needed to stand up.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P66"><text:tab/>When Ryl came out of the exploration, they found themself surrounded by more people than seemed <text:span text:style-name="T100">entirely plausible</text:span>. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T101">They had been expecting that more would have arrived while they traveled, though to be honest, they had forgotten about that in the excitement of their traveling. <text:s/>But when they had considered the size of the group they would be returning to, the group of those so invested in exploration and the cause that they would give up their homes and defy the government, they had always considered it as a handful of individuals, those at the fringe of things, madly invested in other worlds or opposed to the government already. <text:s/>And yet, it would seem, that their cause, the one which they had just given up their life to protect, was a bit more appealing to a general audience then they had expected. <text:s/>This was truly heartening, and made Ryl feel more connected to their people then they had in a gigasecond. <text:s/>There was of course that small part of Ryl that was slightly annoyed that they weren’t quite as unique and special as they had thought, but they quelled that thought easily enough, and enjoyed the brief feeling of connectivity and empathy for those of their own kind instead. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T101">The surprise that was the multitude of people present had distracted Ryl for a moment, but after the initial shock faded, the effects of returning to their own body once again reared their head, and Ryl was forced to retreat to a small section of the room that was private, intended for use in purification acts. <text:s/>They did their business there, then after a few hundred more seconds to compose themselves, they returned to the main chamber, and began peering at all the new faces. <text:s/>They hadn’t seen this many people in one place ever, in their entire life, and so the very physicality of it was almost overwhelming. <text:s/>Or perhaps that was the smell, one of the few things that is commonly not communicated fully when using modern communication methods. <text:s/>Hundreds of fearful rebels all packed in a room together after a lifetime of isolation created something of a specific scent, and it was not one that many present were truly prepared for. <text:s/>It took a few minutes after beginning the initial wandering of the space, before Ryl found themself able to really focus on much of anything, as the odor was aggressive and took a lot of attention at first. <text:s/>Eventually it became a sort of background thing and Ryl was able to ignore it, but still it was present.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P69"><text:tab/>The variety of people present was almost more of a surprise to Ryl then had been the sheer number. <text:s/>Their were people here that Ryl knew to be news hosts, and political leaders, and merchants, none of which had exactly been the kind of people that Ryl had figured would be standing up to the government with them. <text:s/>A hundred scientists and recluses was one thing, but a hundred active members of the community was something else. <text:s/>Somehow, the message, which Ryl had always believed in, but had also always assumed was something only smart and creative people could understand, had made it to the people, and the people were listening to it. <text:s/>Somehow, there were a lot of people that cared about who made them, cared about finding out, and cared about reaching the world which had created this one. <text:s/>Ryl supposed that made sense. <text:s/>It had been perhaps a bit arrogant to assume that the search for answers was purely the domain of the scientist and the explorer. <text:s/>Even if one does not seek the edge of the known as part of their profession, it didn’t mean that expanding that boundary was not incredibly important to you. <text:s/>That had always been the argument for why the government should support the scientists and frontiersfolk in their efforts. <text:s/>And yet, again, Ryl had never really bought the argument, even though they had pushed it. <text:s/>It was obvious now that they had been perhaps a bit elitist in their thinking. <text:s/>But, now was not the time to dwell. <text:s/>Now was a time of action.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T102">The height of action is of course, waiting in a line, a situation that Ryl found themself in just a kilosecond after they had thought so aggressively about it being a time of action. <text:s/>As it turns out, when a few hundred people show up to fight the government, keeping them organized involves effectively creating another government to help facilitate said rebellion. <text:s/>Having done their best to keep themself out of politics their whole life, Ryl was decidedly uncomfortable with this new formality taking a place in their own special rebel zone. <text:s/>But, they wanted to talk to the leaders of the rebellion, and that took </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T102">time when in such a numerous situation. <text:s/>Still, it was not so incredibly bureaucratic as a government situation might have been if it had existed for megasecond or more, and it was only a kilosecond of waiting before Ryl was able to greet their coconspirators. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T102">Ryl, you are back! <text:s/>Tell us what you have learned. <text:s/>Anything promising?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T102">Actually a lot. <text:s/>I figured these people had to know something we didn’t for their method of communication to make sense, but now, after spending a little time getting to know these “Chroma”, for that&apos;s the name that we agreed upon, I believe that this might be the closest we have ever come to having an equal exchange of ideas and culture. <text:s/>Their society has a lot going for it, and may have a good deal to teach our own. <text:s/>Plus, they are quite excited about our general goals. <text:s/>By the time I left them, they were not only beginning work on their own transdimensional communication system, but they were preparing a lesson plan for how best to communicate their own cultural quirks to new peoples which they might encounter. <text:s/>They truly threw themselves into the task. <text:s/>To say I am impressed would be a definite understatement.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T102">That’s incredible Ryl. <text:s/>We are excited to learn more about our newest siblings in the search for the outside world.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T103">I hope to be back in their in not too long at all. <text:s/>If I can start bringing in real scientific or mathematical discoveries which we ourselves had never constructed/thought up, it will add some real weight to our propaganda campaign against the collective actions to shut us down. <text:s/>We’ll see this through and succeed no worries.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T104">A look of some kind passed between the two leaders who had been, only moments ago in Ryl’s experience, nothing more than a couple of folks with some strong beliefs. <text:s/>This look was chilling to Ryl. <text:s/>It was the look of those who were trying to shut them down, the look of those that they were now in rebellion against. <text:s/>It was the look that tended to involve sacrificing the future for the needs of the present. <text:s/>It was a fearful thing to see so early on in the rebellion, and it made Ryl wonder if perhaps they had made the right choice after all. <text:s/>Was this group going to do the right thing if they managed to acquire or exercise power? <text:s/>In the end they supposed it didn’t really matter that much. <text:s/>The important issued would be solved. <text:s/>They could keep exploring, keep living their life in robotic body, and for Ryl, that was enough. <text:s/>At least for now. <text:s/>Still, the look had had meaning, and the words that such looks imply soon followed after it. <text:s/>And as Ryl heard the words, and fully took in their meaning, they felt the sickness return, the feeling of being in the wrong body, except extended to the wrong species, the wrong society. <text:s/>Nausea overtook them even as they listened to the voices of their compatriots. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T105">That’s excellent Ryl. <text:s/>I’m sure that will be extremely valuable in just a short while. <text:s/>However, I think perhaps your talents might be put to a better use in the immediate future. <text:s/>We will return to your color people when time permits, but I’m sure you understand our situation right now is tenuous and certain things have to take priority. <text:s/>We won’t be able to keep going to exciting new realities like that one if we don’t secure our position here. <text:s/>So perhaps you’d be willing to switch your focus for the time being, and help us out on some of the higher priority spaces?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T106">I feel like this is one of the highest spaces. <text:s/>Its a new species that has just been introduced to the wider reality, and it has plenty of new ideas that we could learn from. <text:s/>What could be higher priority than that?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T106">I’m sure they have a great number of wonderful ideas, but perhaps they just aren’t the kind of ideas that are the priority right now. <text:s/>There are other spaces that we know have some more directly applicable ideas available. <text:s/>We only have to convince the right people in those places. <text:s/>And you are so great at explaining our philosophy and creating a rapport. <text:s/>You are needed elsewhere. <text:s/>Your color people will still be there once things are a bit more stable.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T106">Ryl knew there was no arguing here. <text:s/>Somehow during the short while they had been gone, the rebellion had decided that it needed to defeat the government in a physical way. <text:s/>It wanted them to go to one of the realities that was objectively more advanced than their own, and then convince its residents that sharing weapon technology was the right thing to do in this situation. <text:s/>It wanted weapons </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T106">to either defeat the government, or at least scare it sufficiently to give them some peace. <text:s/>Perhaps they were right. <text:s/>Perhaps they did need weapons to combat the government. <text:s/>Maybe fighting would be the only way to keep the exploration moving forward. <text:s/>But perhaps not. <text:s/>Maybe the right people just needed convincing, and maybe the way to do that was to keep doing what they had been doing, keeping exploring and discovering new places and people, and sharing the good things of those places, not the dark scary ones. <text:s/>Ryl didn’t want to be a part of this aggressive plan. <text:s/>They just wanted to continue on, to make the people see the good in what they were doing, not force them to admit it at bombpoint. <text:s/>But, they knew that these people in charge had set their minds. <text:s/>Convincing them wouldn’t work, and so Ryl would have to do what they needed to do in order to do the right thing.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T106">Very well. <text:s/>Allow me to go back and inform our new friends that I will be absent a while. <text:s/>Then I will travel to one of the higher priority spaces. <text:s/>A kilosecond won’t hurt the cause either way.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T106">Of course, keeping friends is important. <text:s/>But make it quick. <text:s/>We only have so long before we are discovered by the government, and we need to be ready by then. <text:s/>Let me give you a list of the spaces we believe to be highest in priority.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T106">Ryl took the list, and turned away from the rebellion leaders. <text:s/>When they looked at it, their feeling of disgust magnified. <text:s/>It had all the worlds that they had expected to find here, but it had a few additions that Ryl had not thought they would stoop to. <text:s/>Those additions were glorified war dimensions, places not committed to the Alliance, but instead simply to the acquisition of technology and power without concern for how it was gotten. <text:s/>It had shaken Ryl’s faith in the mission when they had learned of such places, but had always taken solace in the fact that none of their people had ever done business in places like that. <text:s/>But now, that was where they turned. <text:s/>If they had not truly been on a short timer, they would have spent a good deal of time then dealing with the feelings that those names on the list had provoked. <text:s/>But, they didn’t have time. <text:s/>If they were to do the right thing, they needed to act fast. <text:s/>Thankfully almost all of the things Ryl would be doing would be done in other spaces, in the bodies that were more truly theirs. <text:s/>They knew not if they would have been able to do these things in the form that they were in now. <text:s/>Probably not. <text:s/>So, it was a joy when the connected themselves to the machine they had gotten up from a few kiloseconds ago, and returned to Chroma Space.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T107">The feelings of transfer, of transcendence, that so sickened Ryl when they were used to return to their own space always filled them with joy and awe when they instead were going elsewhere. <text:s/>So it was that their spirit was much bolstered when they at last gained access to their robot body in the Chroma Space. <text:s/>Once there, they immediately began to speak. <text:s/>Like before, the hardest part would be making sure that these people were on board with the the general shape of their plans. <text:s/>Once that had been accomplished, the specifics would work themselves out. <text:s/>But, it would perhaps be difficult to get that approval this time. <text:s/>The Chroma were a people of harmony, of consensus, and here Ryl was, rebelling against a small group, which was itself rebelling against the larger will of their people. <text:s/>They were a double dissident, and perhaps that would be unconscionable to the Chroma. <text:s/>Now was the time to find out. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T107">How one frames a problem was an enormous part of finding a solution to it, and so the task of convincing the Chroma to work with Ryl would come down to whether they could frame the problem in the right way so that the Chroma would see Ryl’s solution as the right one. <text:s/>And so, in order to make the consensus minded Chroma see Ryl’s point of view, they decided to go up one further level, and make it three levels of betrayal, not just two. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T108">They had spoken of the Alliance last time, convincing the Chroma that such a formation of peoples would be an excellent group to join. <text:s/>Now, they framed the Alliance as the top layer, the consensus of people making the correct choice in supporting the exploration of the spaces and the search for the outer reality. <text:s/>Then, from this standpoint, they framed their own people as rebels, wishing to close themselves off, to avoid responsibility. <text:s/>Would it not then be ok to rebel against this smaller consensus if it was in service of the greater? <text:s/>From this perspective, the rebellion within their society was more a return to consensus than a rebellion at all. <text:s/>And Ryl’s rebellion against those rebels? <text:s/>It was </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T108">not a disagreement with the goals of the rebels, but instead the methods. <text:s/>Was it not correct to seek a nonviolent solution, or to explore additional options so that ultimately the group could find the greatest solution? <text:s/>By walking that line of questions, of thoughts, Ryl worked to gain the support of the Chroma. <text:s/>And, it seemed that they indeed had understood their audience, for the Chroma stood in full support of Ryl and their choices. <text:s/>It was now time to explain the plan, and to execute it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T108">With the speed of the Chroma communication method, the first part was finished within a kilosecond. <text:s/>The Chroma wished Ryl good fortune for their part of the plan, and promised to work hard executing their own. <text:s/>They said goodbye, and Ryl logged out, once again feeling the sinking feeling of returning to their original body. <text:s/>They looked around at the people surrounding them. <text:s/>It was possible this was the last time they would see all of them, at least in this way. <text:s/>They knew so few of these people. <text:s/>Were they making the right choice here? <text:s text:c="2"/>Was there a method which might simply involve changing a few minds instead of using force, even if was a gentle sort of force? <text:s/>Probably. <text:s/>But they didn’t know how to do it, and so they only had this plan. <text:s/>Wishing their was a better way was no crime, but doing so at the expense of the plan which would work might be considered one. <text:s/>With this in mind, Ryl communicated with the high command again, explaining that they had finished their mission with the Chroma and were moving on to one of the higher priority worlds. <text:s/>They received salutes and wishes of good fortune and general accolades for making the smart choice. <text:s/>They turned away from this, and once more sat down in the machine which would take them out of this place. <text:s/>They punched in the coordinates to one of these other realities, but added some specifics to the arrival destination that were not in the list specification. <text:s/>Then they activated the machine, and felt themselves once more filled with the euphoria of escape. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T108">The body that they were now residing in had been the first which Ryl had inhabited beside their original. <text:s/>That first exploration had changed Ryl’s life, and this body had been a revelation. <text:s/>In many ways, the technology had improved over time, and the many bodies which Ryl had resided in in other spaces were superior to this one, but still, when Ryl thought to what made them feel perfectly themself, it was this body that their mind recalled. <text:s/>It had been made in a peculiar way. <text:s/>While most of the bodies used for exploration are forged by a specific group of reality hackers back in Ryl’s world, designed for maximum performance and peek power, this one had been a collaboration between one such hacker, a member of this reality, and Ryl themself. <text:s/>It had an elegance to it that the other bodies never had, and it was beautiful to Ryl in a very special way. <text:s/>Before they activated their senses and began the second stage of their plan, they took a moment simply to be in this state, simply to be this person. <text:s/>They let the seconds pass, each filling them with a measure of contentment. <text:s/>When they were full, and felt at peace, they turned everything on, and began moving out of the storage place where this body was held in this world. <text:s/>It was time to visit a very dear friend, one of the co-creators of this body, and perhaps the one person who might make this crazy scheme possible. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T109">They knew, to some extent that it was inevitable that they would find the home of their friend beautiful. <text:s/>While of course it was Ryl’s mind inhabiting and controlling this body, the senses required interpretation before they could be served directly to their mind, and so the aesthetic appreciation for certain things was built into the metallic brain of the body in which they were currently living. <text:s/>Still, Ryl liked to believe that their appreciation for their friends architectural choices went deeper than simply inbuilt aesthetics. <text:s/>They felt connected to their friend, and imagined that that connection could be seen in many forms, including artistic. <text:s/>They felt at peace in these long halls and under these twisting spires, and so they felt at peace with their friend. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P67"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T109">They entered the room that their friend lived within, knowing that sensors had detected them long before this, and that access thus meant invitation. <text:s/>When they arrived however, they were not immediately greeted by their friend. <text:s/>They saw their friend there, but she was connected to her own machine, traveling elsewhere. <text:s/>Ryl considered simply waiting, but cast this thought aside. <text:s/>Instead, they sat down next their friend, hooked themself in, and, ignoring all lessons once learned about the dangers of jumping multiple layers, joined their friend in whatever realm she was currently visiting. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>Wild Space(Yazmit)</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>Yazmit jumped, and arrived in a pure black space. <text:s/>He normally would have simply jumped again, but a thought had struck him. <text:s/>What had happened with the hellspace he had been in? <text:s/>He remembered entering it, he remembered braving its depths, deciding it was too terrible a place to let stand, and vowing to destroy whoever had created such a space. <text:s/>But after that it got a bit hazy. <text:s/>He recalled having finished up his time in the hellspace, looking for clues, but it was all a bit muted, none of the extreme feelings of pain and torment that accompanied the memories from earlier in that space. <text:s/>After that he had went to meet some people, perhaps from the Alliance, in order to help him in his search for the space’s creator. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T110">And, he had succeeded? <text:s/>He didn’t know who it was, or how he had defeated them, but he felt sure that he had. <text:s/>But why couldn’t he recall the later part of the whole situation at all? <text:s/>The obvious conclusion would be that he had erased his own memories, in the same way that he sometimes did in order to protect himself from individuals that might have the ability to read minds or predict actions. <text:s/>But the gradual fading out was unlike that. <text:s/>With that, he wanted to have no memory at all. <text:s/>In fact, even thinking these thoughts was perhaps going to far, and he might have to go and erase this section of his memory in order to be better prepared later. <text:s/>But first he needed to figure this out.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T110">Could it be an outside force? <text:s/>Perhaps. <text:s/>Why leave him with any memories at all then? <text:s/>Maybe they could only access new memories, or perhaps the fact that some of his earlier memories involved an individual that he could at one point converse with, namely the other dimension hopper with whom he had shared some drinks, had made them not want to erase things entirely lest the ruse be discovered. <text:s/>The way it was right now, the situation felt concluded and final, and yet he had no memory of conclusion, nor finale. <text:s/>Only a vague sense that these things had indeed happened. <text:s/>And how could he possibly trust that these vague senses were left by him, and not by someone else, who wanted him to drop the matter? <text:s/>Well, in that case, would they not have simply created fake memories? <text:s/>Maybe, but memories tend to a bit more difficult to create then to erase. <text:s/>And, this had worked for a time. <text:s/>If he hadn’t found himself in a reality with absolutely no stimuli at the exact moment that the thought had passed his mind, then likely he would have been distracted by other things and not considered it again. <text:s/>But he had, and now he was curious. <text:s/>What had happened, and why could he not remember it?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T110">The first step would be going back to people he might have interacted with and asking them about his actions. <text:s/>He could start with the charming lady who had led him into the whole situation to start. <text:s/>A moment later Yazmit jumped back to the reality where he had met her. <text:s/>However, as soon as he arrived, he knew she wasn’t there. <text:s/>The channel for such communications was now empty. <text:s/>He looked for traces of when she had left, and it looked like the timeline matched up with about when he would have went back to see her after finishing her challenge. <text:s/>So he had probably met her, and then gone and done something together. <text:s/>But he had no idea where she, or indeed he, had gone. <text:s/>Perhaps she had left some information with a local of this reality. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T110">It was considered good manners, in the inter dimensional jumping community, to leave something of a guide when you leave a developed reality. <text:s/>You can leave people and places that are good contacts, people that you communicated with, things that you set in motion. It prevented repeating things already done, and it let progress build on progress over time with different jumpers. <text:s/>Plus it was a good way of bragging about all the things you had done, or of pointing the way to any of your own cool creations. <text:s/>There was again, a cosmic function which pointed the way to the location of this cache of information. <text:s/>Yazmit looked it up, then quickly started perusing the information, searching for something that might indicate a place to start looking for clues. <text:s/>The goldmine of course would be if a next destination had been listed, but he flipped to the end, and found that logging had stopped just a bit after he had left for the hell dimension, so there would be nothing about the trip itself in here. <text:s/>But </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T110">perhaps it could point towards someone who knew something. <text:s/>It was time to pay a visit to this ladies friends. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T111">For many jumpers, the mark of excellence was to create as big of an impact as possible while being as subtle as possible. <text:s/>If you could change a world for the better, or introduce a space to the Alliance without using any of the vast array of reality warping powers available to you, then you were truly considered an exemplary jumper. <text:s/>Yazmit however, did not subscribe to this philosophy. <text:s/>He figured his job was to drag these dimensions into the future, and if some dramatics and showmanship could add to the inspiration, then by the Outsiders, he was going to give the locals a show. <text:s/>As such, instead of assuming a normal looking form and approaching the jumper’s old contact in a normal sort of manner, Yazmit cloaked himself in rainbows and appeared before them in a burst of fire. <text:s/>The effect was somewhat diminished by him having to then spend a couple minutes putting out the small host of house fires he had just started in this nice woman’s office, but still, it had been dramatic. <text:s/>He figured it would have made a good impression if only he hadn’t accidentally scorched half of her eyebrows off too. <text:s/>As it was, she was miffed, to put it lightly. <text:s/>Well, live and learn.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T111">Greetings mortal! <text:s/>I am Yazmit the Magnificent, wanderer of the cosmos, and commander of the ever burning flame of Volst! <text:s/>Listen to my words and obey my commands!”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T111">This rebound attempt fell similarly flat when the loud words brought in a bunch of this woman’s coworkers, and Yazmit was forced to go and teleport himself and his intended confidant away when security was called. <text:s/>Now atop a great white mountain, the woman who he had been counting on to help him in his quest began hitting him with her purse.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T111">What the hell do you think you are doing? <text:s/>You burned my office! <text:s/>You burned my clothes! <text:s/>You burned off one of my eyebrows! <text:s/>And now we are freezing to death on a mountain top because you couldn’t keep your voice down enough to avoid getting security called on you! <text:s/>Who the hell are you and why are you so thrice damned stupid!” <text:s/>Yazmit figured that the theatrics had perhaps gone to far, and that a more direct approach might be prudent in this situation.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T112">Well, I told you my name already. <text:s/>Its Yazmit. <text:s/>The part about being a wielder of the ever burning flame of Volst might be something of a fabrication, but I do wander the cosmos, indeed, many cosmos. <text:s/>Uh… sorry about the eyebrows and such.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T112">You’d better be more than sorry bucko. <text:s/>If you have the power to summon flames and teleport us all around like this, then I imagine you have the power to fix this crap. <text:s/>And you’d better get on that right quick if you want me to talk to you at all. <text:s/>Heck, if I were you, I might consider throwing in a few extra gifts and fixes as a show of reparation.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T112">That uh… well you see… I don’t usually go about fixing things...” <text:s/>Yazmit stopped this line of dialogue, judging that, perhaps this time, he might do well to do the fixing of the things. <text:s/>“Right then. <text:s/>I’ll be right back.” <text:s/>He jumped back to her office, making himself invisible, then set about fixing things up. <text:s/>He rebuilt the stuff he had burned, erased a few memories here and there, then moved some stuff around, and did some work on the company computer systems. <text:s/>Then he hopped back to the mountaintop, jumped the two of them to a sunny beach instead, then fixed the woman’s eyebrows and clothes. <text:s/>“That better? <text:s/>I fixed your office, erased everyone’s memories of my big entrance, and gave you two extra weeks of vacation days in your companies computers, with a few appropriate memory adjustments to account for that.” <text:s/>The woman continued to frown at him.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T112">Its a start. <text:s/>I think perhaps some new clothes appropriate to our venue would be in order, and then perhaps some kind of apology is in order.” <text:s/>Yazmit wanted to object, but the woman’s unmoving expression made him once again reconsider. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T113">Let’s see. <text:s/>I don’t know much about fashion in this reality, but I’ll give it a shot.” <text:s/>He zoomed his mind out and about, scanning the styles that he saw woman wearing in similar locations around the world, then aggregated them, created a few variations and copied some aesthetic appreciation processes in some local’s brains, and used those to pick the best variant. <text:s/>That decided, he created the clothing from raw atoms, and then jumped it to their present location. <text:s/>“How do you like this?” he asked.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T113">Well, there might just be some hope for you after all. <text:s/>That’s beautiful. <text:s/>You didn’t steal it from anyone did you?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T113">Of course not. <text:s/>I created it, just for you. <text:s/>Nothing else like it in this reality. <text:s/>Well, technically there are a lot of things like it, but nothing too similar at least.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T113">OK, this seems acceptable. <text:s/>I’ll slip into this, we can sit down on the beach here, you can give me that apology, and we might actually be able to start communicating. <text:s/>Sound good?” <text:s/>Yazmit did not think it really sounded that good at all. <text:s/>He had been hoping to have the info and be gone in an instant. <text:s/>But, he’d already invested an absurd amount of time and effort into this woman, so he wasn’t about to throw it all away now. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T113">Sure thing. <text:s/>Just make it quick ok. <text:s/>I got things to do.” <text:s/>The woman’s eyebrows shot up. <text:s/>“I mean, uh… take your time. <text:s/>I um… would really enjoy a chance to sit down with you and apologize for what I did. <text:s/>Could you spare the time?” <text:s/>Something almost like a smile flickered along the ladies lips, the first time he had seen anything remotely positive there.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T113">I think I could find it in my schedule. <text:s/>Why don’t you go find us some drinks and learn how to back massage, then meet back here in fifteen OK Yazmit darling?” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T113">Back massage, fifteen?!”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T113">Oh, I’m sorry, I meant twenty minutes and full body massage. <text:s/>Run along dear.” <text:s/>It took Yazmit a great deal of concentration not to snap back at the woman. <text:s/>What the hell had the other jumper seen in this gal, making her their prime contact point here? <text:s/>Well, he’d gone this far. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Very well ma’am. <text:s/>Is there anything else you will be needing?” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Well, since you offered, I could really do with a pedicure as well. <text:s/>You think you could learn how to do that too?” <text:s/>Suppressed fury.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Of course. <text:s/>Anything else?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“Hmm…<text:span text:style-name="T114"> nothing I can think of right now. <text:s/>I’ll let you know if I think of something though. <text:s/>That’ll be alright right?” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Of course ma’am. <text:s/>I’m here to serve.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Excellent. <text:s/>See you in a half an hour then.” <text:s/>Yazmit jumped himself out of there before she could hear him scream. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Of all the conceited, controlling, conniving...” <text:s/>Yazmit managed to calm himself down. <text:s/>He looked back through his memories, found all the random skills she had asked him to learn, and quickly downloaded them from relevant masters of those arts. <text:s/>He then conjured up a few drinks he knew were particular favorites in this kind of situation, then he waited, steaming. <text:s/>To bide his time, he went and read everything about this woman in the dossier that the jumper had left behind. <text:s/>Not a single negative thing. <text:s/>A great deal about her likes and dislikes, an incredible amount of praise for her skills, and a lot of records of activities and events that they had done together. <text:s/>Well, at least it looked like this woman had been a big part of the jumper’s life, and a confidant, so it was looking likely that she would actually know something. <text:s/>If he had gone through all of this just for the woman to tell him she knew nothing at all, then he would have killed her, right there and then. <text:s/>But, it was looking like this might all be worth it in the end, if she could lead him to the jumper, and the jumper could lead him to whoever had screwed with his memories. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T114">After the appropriate period of time, Yazmit jumped back to the beach, making sure to chill the drinks again as he jumped, and conjuring a few chairs when he saw that the lady hadn’t seen fit to find any during the intermittent time. <text:s/>She gave him an actual smile when he showed up with the drinks and the chairs, and he had to admit that by the standards of this reality, she certainly looked good in the outfit he had designed. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Took you long enough. <text:s/>I was beginning to grow bored waiting for you.” <text:s/>Yazmit bit down and ground his teeth. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">My apologies miss. <text:s/>I must have misheard you when you mentioned the time. <text:s/>It did seem to change a lot.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Such things happen I suppose. <text:s/>You’ll just have to do better next time. <text:s/>Well, anyways, you are here now. <text:s/>Perhaps we can combine activities. <text:s/>I think the massage first, then you can mix your apology and the pedicure. <text:s/>Then we’ll see if we have time for a little chat.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Sounds perfect ma’am. <text:s/>I live to serve.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Really? <text:s/>How delightful. <text:s/>In that case, I’ll add some meaning to your life. <text:s/>If you wouldn’t mind reading me some of my work emails while we do the massage, I’ll dictate the responses and you can type them up. <text:s/>If you do that really well, I promise I’ll find some extra work for you after that too.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P70"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">OK, I lied. <text:s/>I don’t live to serve. <text:s/>I’m actually in a big hurry.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Oh, and you were doing so well too. <text:s/>Why don’t we pretend you actually do live to serve, and we’ll go from there? <text:s/>Otherwise, we can cut this meeting short, and you can go off and do your own thing without me.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P73"><text:tab/>“You realize I could rip the information I want from your head right? <text:s/>That I am humoring this at all is simply out of respect for your departed mistress.”</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P73"><text:tab/>“Ooh, Zero for two there. <text:s/>You actually can’t rip anything from my head, nor was my good friend my mistress. <text:s/>Quite the opposite really. <text:s/>She really did enjoy all this kind of serving stuff. <text:s/>And I’m afraid I had gotten quite used to it. <text:s/>So, we are going to keep going through this at exactly my pace, or you are going to leave with no more information than you came in with.” <text:s/>Yazmit was not about to take that statement at face value, and so he tried to scan the woman, to read her mind. <text:s/>Failure. <text:s/>He tried jumping with her again, but this time it didn’t work. <text:s/>He looked at the data. <text:s/>His face went pale. <text:s/>Not only could he do nothing to this woman, he couldn’t actually do anything to anyone within like fifty miles of her presence without her permission. <text:s/>She had local administration rights for everything in her vicinity, and those rights somehow included his hacked powers. <text:s/>It looks like the jumper really had fallen for this woman, and had done a lot to protect her in her absence. <text:s/>Considering she had been here for a while, it made sense she knew the ins and outs of this place better than he. <text:s/>Could he maybe find a way around it given enough time? <text:s/>Probably. <text:s/>But it would be faster and much less dangerous to just go along with this woman’s mad whims. <text:s/>Much more humiliating of course, but that was the situation he was in. <text:s/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Right you are ma’am. <text:s/>I’d really appreciate getting the chance to do anything I can for you. <text:s/>Your every whim is my greatest pleasure.” <text:s/>The woman’s smile in response to this was almost enough to make Yazmit drop the whole thing and just nuke the planet from orbit.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T114">Why Yazmit dear, how very forward of you. <text:s/>You are incredibly lucky to have found me. <text:s/>As it turns out, I am very good at giving orders, and very used to being waited upon. <text:s/>If you play your cards right, you just might end up serving me for life.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T115">Nothing would make me happier.” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T115">Wonderful. <text:s/>Well, you had best get started. <text:s/>Body massage and emails first right? <text:s/>Then I’ll let you have a little fun, and you can go deliver some messages for me. <text:s/>Once that gets done, maybe we’ll start with the pedicure and apology, though maybe you’ll get lucky and I’ll think of some more things to do in the meantime.” <text:s/>Yazmit had a hard time expressing words at this point and mumbled something. <text:s/>“I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you. <text:s/>Can you say that again? <text:s/>Something about your great love and respect for your mistress?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T115">Indeed mistress. <text:s/>I can’t express how much I appreciate all you are doing for me. <text:s/>I love and respect you my mistress and I wish always to serve you.” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T115">How cute. <text:s/>Well, we’ll see what happens won’t we. <text:s/>You’ll have to earn it of course.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T115">And thus began Yazmit’s trials. <text:s/>He did everything the woman asked him to do, and he did it well. <text:s/>Of course, since the conceit they were playing under was that he wanted more commands from her, each task accomplished meant yet more added. <text:s/>He knew of course that doing the opposite would just be worse, and so he kept at it. <text:s/>At last, after far too long, they reached the point where he was allowed to give his apology. <text:s/>He scarcely remembered what he had done to start this whole chain of events at that point, but this didn’t stop him at all. <text:s/>The apology was a thing of beauty, a real epic of the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T115">ages. <text:s/>It wove together all the possible character defects he might have, all the ways he would and had made up for them, all the great and wonderful qualities of this woman, who, he realized with a start, half way through the apology, he still didn’t know the name of, and just sheer regret for his actions. <text:s/>The woman went and gave him a standing ovation when he was done. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T116">Why, that was great Yazmit. <text:s/>I had figured you’d be good at it, being able to draw from the minds of all the great artists of our era, but still, you really blew that one out of the park. <text:s/>I think, maybe, you might just have made up for your grand entrance. <text:s/>Don’t get snippy with me of course, or we’ll get back to the labors and tasks, but for now, lets just talk OK?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T116">I’d like nothing more.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T116">Good. <text:s/>Well, I think I might know what you are going to ask about. <text:s/>You want to know where my former servant went off to, and you want to know what you got up to, and you want to know if anything weird happened that I knew about after you came back from the hell place. <text:s/>Am I on the right track?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T116">That about sums it up, yeah. <text:s/>You got anything for me?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T116">I do. <text:s/>I actually know the answers to all those questions. <text:s/>But, as you may have figured out by now, I tend to require payments for services rendered, and I tend to be pretty extreme in the kind of things I get out of people. <text:s/>So, what do you think I want for these answers?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T116">My guess would be an eternal servant. <text:s/>So I either need to get back the jumper who used to live here, or I need to come back and spend a certain percentage of my time here working for you.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T116">Right on the money. <text:s/>You are a lot smarter than your entrance suggested you were. <text:s/>I suppose when one has a great deal of power, they tend to forget the need to use it cleverly.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T116">Perhaps you are right. <text:s/>In my case, I think its more that I find the less clever methods more enjoyable. <text:s/>But maybe sometimes that can have downsides. <text:s/>Regardless, I will certainly do my best to get your jumper back. <text:s/>I needed to find her anyways. <text:s/>I am not particularly willing to give up my own freedom though. <text:s/>I barely stopped myself from destroying your planet during our last couple days, so I hate to think what might happen if I tried that for an extended period of time.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T116">Well, I could actually help with that. <text:s/>My servant made me a copy of the part of her brain which so enjoyed being ordered around. <text:s/>I’m sure a man of your talents could copy that into your own brain with little difficulty. <text:s/>Then you’d enjoy it, and I’d have my servant. <text:s/>But still, as charming as you are, I think I enjoyed my old one more, so if you can get her, that would be better for all involved.” <text:s/>Yazmit shuddered at the idea of changing his brain to enjoy that sort of thing. <text:s/>He had of course altered his brain on a number of occasions, but still, that seemed extreme. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T117">Well, why don’t you give me the info I need to find and bring back the other jumper, then once I do that you can give me the rest?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T117">That would seem to be the easiest way to do this, but I’m afraid its not quite that simple. <text:s/>All of the information together is what its going to take for you to get her back. <text:s/>But then of course, I have no bargaining chip. <text:s/>So, I will need reassurances before I give you the data.” <text:s/>Yazmit’s face whitened.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T117">You want me to change my mind to enjoy being ordered around now, and trust you’ll have me change back once I’ve completed this task. <text:s/>That’s insane. <text:s/>It would be so incredibly easy for you to keep me like that forever.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T117">Its true, and yet that’s the situation. <text:s/>You trust me, or you leave.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T117">We can put some kinda conditional on it, program in some situation that---”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T117">Nope. <text:s/>My terms. <text:s/>You trust me, or there is no deal. <text:s/>You can walk away and never learn what happened here, never figure out where your missing memory is. <text:s/>Or you can learn to enjoy life a little, give me a little trust, and learn everything you wanted to know. <text:s/>Also, just to be a jerk, you have 10 seconds to do it or no deal.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P71"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T117">Yazmit’s mind raced. <text:s/>He couldn’t do this. <text:s/>This was insane. <text:s/>No sane person would accept these terms. <text:s/>He felt the time passing. <text:s/>He thought about everything he didn’t know. <text:s/>Only a few seconds left. <text:s/>Nothing for it. <text:s/>He changed his mind. <text:s/>She smiled, and told him what to do. <text:s/>He loved it.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:soft-page-break/>15</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>Sol Space(Tazkia)</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>Her new job was fun. <text:s/>So far she hadn’t really gotten to do anything, but she had done a heck of a lot of research, catching up on a few thousand years of attempts to hack one’s way out of reality. <text:s/>There had been so many strategies, so many ideas, so many failures. <text:s/>Of particular note was how many of the times that a strategy at first seemed promising, but then proved to have some fatal flaw. <text:s/>Initial results seemed almost worthless considering how many times it had seemed like they were almost there, only to have their hopes dashed once they tried real execution. <text:s/>The history was fascinating. <text:s/>The only downside was that all of this research tended to cut into her time to play games. <text:s/>She had learned from Safeerah that the time freezing bit worked within the context of her reality, but all of other realities kept going at full speed, so trying to get in extra time between research rushes didn’t actually speed up her progress at all. <text:s/>She’d still asked Safeerah to do it a couple of times, when she had really wanted to play a few games after a full day of studying in school, then studying reality hacking, but generally she just played less games, which, as it turned out, kinda stressed her out. <text:s/>It wasn’t enough to worry her, and the general coolness of her studying generally made up for it, but she had been playing hours of games a day for most of her life at this point, and not having that stress reliever turned out to make things more difficult than she was used to. <text:s/>She could give up sleep instead, but she already did so much of that, that anything more also led to a good deal of problems.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>Tazkia had thought she had come up with a good solution to this last problem, and asked Safeerah if she could rewire her brain to not need sleep, but Safeerah explained that, while possible, such a change would likely affect Tazkia’s thinking and personality in such an extreme way that it would make her almost a different person. <text:s/><text:span text:style-name="T118">Annoyed that her plan hadn’t gotten off the ground, she spent a good chunk of her free time the next day trying to brainstorm additional ways to fit more time into a single day. <text:s/>Could she skip eating? <text:s/>Really that wouldn’t add much, cause she almost always ate while she was doing other stuff anyways. <text:s/>Could she cut class? <text:s/>Technically, but everything in her upbringing screamed at the very thought of that. <text:s/>Could she skip prayer? <text:s/>Yes, but again, she felt like she’d be losing a part of herself to do that. <text:s/>What about just straight up amping up her thinking speed? <text:s/>Could Safeerah speed her synapses up without screwing up her personality?</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T118">Turned out the answer to that one was a yes. <text:s/>Safeerah was hesitant to make many changes to Tazkia’s brain, as it was her thought processes that had attracted her to her in the first place, but if it was just a pure speed increase, then it shouldn’t cause too many problems. <text:s/>Safeerah was careful to explain all the possible side effects to Tazkia, but when she saw that Tazkia was willing to go with them, she relented. <text:s/>And so, after a day to do research on exactly how to go about overclocking the human brain, Safeerah went and gave Tazkia super brain speed. <text:s/>From that starting point, it was pretty easy to convince her to go and amp up Tazkia’s physical attributes as well, and soon enough, Tazkia basically had super powers, which was pretty dang awesome. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T118">There were downsides of course. <text:s/>Tazkia’s main game became almost comically easy. <text:s/>The hardest part was making sure she made enough intentional errors so that she didn’t get banned for being a bot. <text:s/>She shot up the ladder, and as she approached rank one, she realized she might have to start dealing with offers from pro teams if she didn’t chill out, and while the idea of going pro as a gamer had always seemed awesome to her, right now it felt like she would be cheating, plus she would have even less time then. <text:s/>She hit rank one, just to prove she could do it, but then she let herself fall back down, doing as many additional tasks as possible while she played so that she would not simply crush everyone else. <text:s/>This led to her doing research and playing games at the same time though, which ultimately was a huge time saver, though it definitely made the game part less relaxing. <text:s/>There were single player games that she had never had the reaction speed for before that were now quite enjoyable, but others, which had previously been challenging, now were basically pointless. <text:s/>Her rivalry with Jake died out once her new skills put her on a whole ‘nother league from him, and that kinda affected the </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T118">whole dynamic of the LAN club. <text:s/>She’d had to drop out of her martial arts classes, cause her new strength was too intense and she had accidentally hurt a couple people before she quit. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T119">On the flip side, she now had a track and field scholarship paying her whole tuition, and she was getting top marks in all her classes since she had so much more time to think through each step of the process, both while learning, and while taking tests and doing projects. <text:s/>She’d had to take some drug tests after a few people had been amazed at her increase in physical and mental skills, but, after passing she was basically everyone’s favorite student, a rising star in any field she put her mind or body towards. <text:s/>She’d been somewhat famous among the gamer crowd as one of the best couple students in school, but now she was famous with normies as well, which was a new experience for her. <text:s/>She didn’t dislike it though. <text:s/>It was kinda fun having everyone know who she was. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T120">She might very well have started getting a big head, what with being better than everyone at everything now, but Safeerah managed to keep her a bit grounded. <text:s/>Despite nominally having finished the job of attracting Tazkia to join the Alliance, Safeerah kept up her persona, kept playing games, and started doing other things around campus as well. <text:s/>And if Tazkia was superhuman, Safeerah was beyond that. <text:s/>And so, there was still someone for Tazkia to strive against, for her to compete with, and she could not rely on brute force, in mind or body, to succeed at all tasks. <text:s/>When she played against Safeerah, she had to outwit her, not just play faster, and it was humbling to go out running with her and get left in the dust. <text:s/>The days were passing, and it was getting close to the end of the semester. <text:s/>Snow had started to fall. <text:s/>It was at this time that Safeerah’s friend arrived, and Tazkia got a chance to actually start making a difference. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T120">The initial meeting was surprising, to say the least. <text:s/>There was a certain amount of subtlety in Safeerah’s reality warping. <text:s/>It had a very matrix-y vibe to it, with things that were obviously impossible seeming more like things that were simply improbably or difficult. <text:s/>The arrival of the friend was anything but that. <text:s/>It was simply and straightforwardly outside of reality. <text:s/>Tazkia and Safeerah had been walking in the park, talking about what Tazkia had just been researching, when suddenly, without even a sound, a slim, androgynous, robot person appeared out of nowhere, literally just popped into existence right in front of Safeerah. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T120">Oops,” it said, robot eyes swiveling to look at Tazkia, then turning back towards Safeerah. <text:s/>“Is this one informed. <text:s/>Did I screw something up for you Blue?” <text:s/>It was a credit to Tazkia’s super speed brain, that she got over her shock before it affected her ability to contribute to a conversation.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“Um…<text:span text:style-name="T120"> hi. <text:s/>Unless there is more I need to be informed about, I think I’m in the loop. <text:s/>Realities a simulation, we are trying to break out, there is a big alliance thing. <text:s/>Did I miss anything?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T120">Nope, looks like you are one of us. <text:s/>Sorry for interrupting you. <text:s/>It looks like you were having a nice walk. <text:s/>I’m afraid I have urgent business with Blue though.” <text:s/>Safeerah responded now.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T120">I go by Safeerah in this reality Ryl. <text:s/>I’m happy to help, of course, but anything you might need to say, you can feel free to share with my friend here. <text:s/>She is one of us, as you said.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T120">Very well. <text:s/>If you are sure. <text:s/>I’m kinda mixed up in a whole double treasony sort of thing, and I need your help breaking myself out of my home reality, transferring my mind to another reality, and then tricking my home reality into thinking I am a visitor from a far more advanced reality than them, but one they have never heard of before. <text:s/>You ok with that?” <text:s/>The robot person stopped for a moment and then added, in a smaller voice. <text:s/>“I’m really glad I’m in this body for this. <text:s/>I definitely could not have been so straightforward at home.” <text:s/>Tazkia was startled. <text:s/>Treason? <text:s/>What does double treason even mean? <text:s/>Breaking out of a reality? <text:s/>Tricking one’s own reality? <text:s/>Who the heck was this person? <text:s/>They certainly didn’t seem trustworthy.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T120">Of course we’ll help Ryl, I trust you completely. <text:s/>I’d enjoy hearing the reasoning for all this as we get going, but I imagine this is a bit time sensitive.” <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T120">You can say that again. <text:s/>Thanks Bl- I mean Safeerah. <text:s/>I was kinda in a bad spot.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T120">Any time dear. <text:s/>Now, why don’t you give us the details so we can get started on extricating you from your double treason. <text:s/>Or are we helping you accomplish the treasons? <text:s/>Whichever.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:soft-page-break/><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T120">Bit of both really, depending on your perspective. <text:s/>But yeah, you are right. <text:s/>How much context does your protege need?”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T120">I don’t think she knows much, if anything about your reality specifically. <text:s/>She has enhanced brain functions in this reality though, so I’ll give her the background on your place as you tell your story.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T120">Perfect. <text:s/>I’ll begin then.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T121">Ryl told them the story of their recent adventures, about the discovery that their government was going to stop supporting explorations, about their meeting with the Chroma people, about the formation of a rebel faction to continue exploring despite the government, and that factions subsequent shift in tone towards a militant anti government group, seeking to use the power of dimensional travel as a weapon, as opposed to as an end in itself. <text:s/>And then Ryl described their plan for how to deal with it. <text:s/>They wished to make a real transfer, to actually move their mind from one reality to another, instead of simply controlling a body in another dimension with the mind that remained back in the original space. <text:s/>This was, Tazkia learned, a bit dangerous and difficult, plus filled with the same ethical dilemmas that a lot of teleportation scenarios ran into, that on some level you were just making a copy and then killing the original, and not really moving anything. <text:s/>There were ways of making it work, and ways around the paradox to some extent, but they required much more advanced technology and an understanding of dimensional travel that Ryl’s race simply didn’t have access to. <text:s/>This, as it turned out, was where Safeerah came in. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T121">You know the risks Ryl. <text:s/>Are you really OK with this? <text:s/>It can probably be done without a real transfer.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T121">Yeah, I know, but it would be harder, and less likely. <text:s/>Also… I don’t want to live in my home dimension anymore, or my home body. <text:s/>I’ve always felt more comfortable elsewhere. <text:s/>Its the best way for my plan to work, but its also what I want.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/>“<text:span text:style-name="T121">OK, Ryl, I’ll help. <text:s/>But first, lets go through what the plan is after that.”</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T121">Tazkia was glad for this additional explanation, cause she really had no idea why transferring a mind to another reality would help fix any of the problems except as a simple method of escape. <text:s/>And escape was reasonable and fine of course, and from the sounds of it, something worth doing on its own in this scenario, but the fact that this transfer was somehow tied into a whole plan to save Ryl’s race from itself had not made much sense to her yet. <text:s/>Thankfully, it turned out there was something of a point. <text:s/>Basically it came down to the fact that the original dimension of a mind controlling a remote body could be traced. <text:s/>This wasn’t always easy, especially if the mind came from a more advanced civilization, but it was possible. <text:s/>And making the home dimension of Ryl’s mind not be Ryl’s home dimension was integral to their plan. <text:s/>Which, after the explanation, made sense. <text:s/>With now sufficient context, Ryl’s plan started to make more sense, and once the explanations were finished, Tazkia actually thought there was a certain amount of charm to it. <text:s/>Not that it would have mattered if she hadn’t, as at this point, she was going to defer to Safeerah’s experience in this matter, and Safeerah had been all aboard from the moment Ryl had arrived and said “help”. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P75"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T122">For Tazkia, this whole situation set her mind to ease about some fears she hadn’t even really admitted to herself. <text:s/>It was obvious that this Ryl character had had a similar sort of relationship with Safeerah as the one that Tazkia now had. <text:s/>And the fact that Safeerah still trusted and valued this individual now meant a lot as far as her long term commitment to the people she sought out and taught. <text:s/>The concern that she hadn’t really put into words, that she was just another soldier recruited to the cause for Safeerah, was much reduced by the interactions that she saw here. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P75"><text:span text:style-name="T122"><text:tab/>The other thing that had been bothering her a bit was almost the opposite of that first concern, the fact that Safeerah was still spending so much time with her after having recruited her and given her a job. <text:s/>Tazkia had been wondering, on some level, whether perhaps she was being slow, needing extra assistance, and had been concerned that Safeerah didn’t trust her alone yet. <text:s/>But again, this fear was vanquished by the interactions, as it soon became apparent that Safeerah was really just a big softy, and </text:span><text:soft-page-break/><text:span text:style-name="T122">really enjoyed helping and mentoring people. <text:s/>So, despite the general concern and skepticism surround Ryl, and their sudden appearance, in the end, as the conversation waned, and they began actually implementing something of a plan, Tazkia found herself feeling a weight lift off her shoulders, a weight she had not, until then, even realized she had been carrying. <text:s/>The fact that this was Tazkia’s first chance to actually do something, to actually make a difference in the cosmic scheme of things helped a good deal too. <text:s/>It was fair to describe Tazkia’s general mental state at that point as pumped. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P76"><text:tab/><text:span text:style-name="T122">With that enthusiasm driving her, plus her own natural inclination to put herself fully into whatever task she might find herself performing, Tazkia leaped into the task she was assigned for the plan. <text:s/>It was, naturally, a way harder problem than anything her training had thus far prepared her for, but Tazkia attacked it none the less. <text:s/>Her part in doing the transfer was comparing the fundamental physics of the two dimensions of the transfer, Ryl’s homespace, and the Chroma Space, and look for what adjustments would have to be made to compensate, in order to avoid having Ryl’s mind destroyed by minor differences in basic mathematics or physics. <text:s/>It was interesting work, and Ryl was really glad that she had had that one phase in high school where she got really into topology, because otherwise, she was pretty sure she would have been completely lost. <text:s/>As it was, she was simply mostly lost, which necessitated a certain amount of found, which if one was clever and hard working, one could parlay into more and more found, and less and less lost. <text:s/>And seeing as Tazkia was both of those things in spades, she slowly figured out better ways of solving her problem, even as she used those ways to step through the problem. <text:s/></text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P76"><text:span text:style-name="T122"><text:tab/>There was, in the middle, a certain amount of existential dread, when she realized that all this stuff that she was bootstrapping up would be used to literally define someone’s mind, and that if she screwed up, even a little, then this person would either die, or have their mind irrevocably altered. <text:s/>She brought this up with the other two, and at first their dismissive “you got this, no worries” kind of response irked Tazkia, but after a while of stewing on it, she realized it really said more about their trust in her competence, and their focus on their own tasks then it did in a lack of interest in her own. <text:s/>So, her faith somewhat restored, she got back to work. <text:s/>She did tend to do a bit more double checking after that though, as the fact that this work could result in life, death, or insanity, definitely made it warrant a little bit of extra care. <text:s/>Time passed, problems were solved, and a few days later, it was time to implement the plan. <text:s/>Tazkia’s guidelines were fed into the program which would transfer the mind. <text:s/>There was a brief bit of panic when they got a compile error, and Tazkia discovered she had messed up a sign somewhere. <text:s/>They fixed it, and Tazkia, for the first time in her life, thanked the gods of rigorous static typing. <text:s/>After the fix, the code compiled, and they were ready to go.</text:span></text:p>
